This cdrom includes the source code, executables, documentation
and research papers for the Sprite network operating system.  Sprite
is a distributed systems research project led by Prof. John Ousterhout
in the Computer Science Department of the University of California
at Berkeley.  Besides Prof. Ousterhout, the research team has
included Brent Welch, Andrew Cherenson, Fred Douglis, Mike Nelson,
Adam de Boor, Mendel Rosenblum, Mary Baker, Bob Bruce, John Hartman,
Ken Shirriff, Mike Kupfer, Jim Mott-Smith, Geoff Voelker, and Matt
Secor.  Many others have also contributed to the system.

Nothing on this cdrom is guaranteed to work.  This collection of
source, executables, documentation and papers was put together in
a great hurry.  While we were able to test some aspects, much was
left untested.  Make what use of it you can, but we will not be
available to fix problems.

===========================================================================

This disc conforms to the level 1 ISO-9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.
If your operating system supports Rock Ridge, you can access the files using
the full Unix pathnames.  If your system does not support Rock Ridge, the
filenames are limited to eight single-case characters, with an extension of
up to three characters.  Each directory on this disc has a file named
00_TRANS.TBL, that maps the ISO-9660 compliant filenames to the original
Unix-style filenames.  The programs /util/cd_copy.c and /util/cd_link.c
can be used to copy or link the files on the cdrom using the original
filenames on systems without Rock Ridge extensions.

This cdrom contains the following files and directories:

admin:          directory for administrative programs, scripts and information
boot.txt:       file with information about booting the Sprite kernel images
docs:           directory for documentation

sun4.bt:        boot image for Sprite on a SparcStation 2
lib:            directory for library files other than source files
filename.lst    A list of all the files on the disc
ls_lR:          output from ls -lR, a recursive list of the files on the disc
man:            directory for manual pages
papers:         directory for research papers about Sprite
readme.txt:     file that describes this CD-ROM
sprite.txt:     file with a history of the Sprite project
