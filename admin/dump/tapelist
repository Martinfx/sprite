#
# This file is a list of tape drives for the dumper to use. 
# Format is:
# <deviceName> <level>
#
# For example the following line (without the '#' character):
# /dev/exb1.nr 0
#
# tells the dumper that the device "/dev/exb1.nr" is to be used for
# level 0 dumps.  If the level does not follow the device name then the
# device can be used for any level of dump. 
# The dumper will use the tapes in the order in which they appear in
# this file.

/dev/rst04.nr
/dev/rst05.nr
