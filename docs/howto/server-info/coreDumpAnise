This is a little note on how to get a kernel core image off anise.

Step 1) Make sure Anise is in the debugger. If not, put it in the debugger.

Step 2) Login to allspice as root (or any other account that doesn't have
	a home directory or search path on anise's disk.). Go to a file system
	with > 20 megabytes free space. I suggest the directory /swap1/cores

Step 2.5) Test to make sure that anise is in the debugger.  "kmsg -v anise"
	  should work at this time.

Step 3) Run kgcore as follows: "kgcore -v anise"
        The -v is optional but I like it because it prints progress messages.
	Note that this step can take several (~ 2) minutes.

Step 4) Rename the file "vmcore" so something more meaningful such as 
	"mv vmcore vmcore.anise.crash.11-21".   

Step 5) Reboot anise.
