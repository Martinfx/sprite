Sometimes the printer queue gets stuck and files start piling
up in the spool directory.  When this happens, here are some
things that you can try to get things working again.

1.  Check the ownership of the spool directory.  It should be
    owned by `daemon'.  If is owned by root or a user, then the
    daemon may not have permission to create files there.

2.  Check the permissions on the lock file.  If the group execute
    bit is set, the queue is disabled.

3.  If the printer is on a remote machine, you should make sure
    that machine is up.  If you look in /etc/printcap, the `rm' field
    will tell you what machine it is being forwarded to, and the `rp'
    field will tell you the name of the printer on the remote machine.

    Make sure that your machine is listed in /etc/host.equiv and 
    /etc/hosts.lpd on the remote machine.

4.  Kill the printer daemon (lpd) and delete all the files in the
    queue.  Then restart the daemon.

5.  Get some incense, and a live chicken.  Dim the lights,
    and light the incense.  Slaughter the chicken on top of the
    printer, while chanting `postscript, postscript, ...'  Let
    the chicken blood drip onto the printer, while you power
    cycle it repeatedly.  Resubmit your print job.  If the queue is
    still stuck, repeat this step using a lamb or a goose instead of
    a chicken.
