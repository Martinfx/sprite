How to setup your account to use X11R4 on Sprite.

Step 0) - (Only needed until /dev/fb is implemented.)  If your machine is not
	  a standard monochrome display be sure that there is an entry for
	  it in /X11/R4/lib/fbtypes.  

Step 1) - Add /X11/R4/cmds to your path. If you path contains X11R3 or X11R2
	  binaries be sure that /X11/R4/cmds is before these.

Step 2) - There seems to be about ten different ways of starting X. Here's the
	  one I use:  Type "xinit". If you would like something more than a
	  single "tx" window at start up, create a script named ".xinitrc".
	  Xinit will run this script and when the script exits so will the
	  X server. A sample .xinitrc file can be found in ~newuser/.xinitrc
	  This .xinitrc runs the script $HOME/.xsetup. A sample .xsetup file
	  can be found in ~newuser/.xsetup.

Notes:
	1) If you have a file named ".xserverrc" in your home directory it
	   will most likely break something.  Please delete it.  
	   Users with accounts that start with dedood, drewes, elm, hunt,
	   johnw, krste, leong, sah, schauser, ss, tve, or wlo should follow
	   this note.
	2) The X11 R4 twm is not totally backward compatible with the new twm.
	   The problem that bites most people is lines in the .twmrc like:

	   Button1 = mc  : window  : f.resize

	   are no longer legal.  The correct form is:

	   Button1 = m | c  : window  : f.resize
