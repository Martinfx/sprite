Traditionally you X defaults live in ~/.Xdefaults, but this need not be, and
it is actually to in your advantage to place them somewhere else!
   Ok, when a clients needs a default value, it first asks the server which
looks into its (megabytes) of memory; if that fails the server looks
for an environment variable called XENVIRONMENT for a file name (or
takes ~/.Xdefaults) and looks into that file. If that also fails, some
system-wide file or a hard-coded value is used (I actually dunno).

~/.Xdefaults vs. xrdb:
In a nutshell: if you load the defaults into the server (see below), it's
supposed to be faster, your defaults are piped thru cpp and all applications
get the same defaults. If you don't load them into the server and rely
on ~/.Xdefaults, the defaults are easier to change (edit the file) but
if you rlogin to another machine and start a client there, that client
will see a (probably) different ~/.Xdefaults file (I mean if you rlogin
to a non-sprite host). So once you are comfortable with your defaults,
I suggest you use xrdb to load the defaults into the server.

How to load the defaults into the server:
Place the following command into your ~/.xinitrc script (or type it
after you edit your ~/.Xdefaults):
	xrdb -load ~/.Xdefaults
If you want to try some new defaults quickly, type "xrdb -merge" which
reads additional defaults from stdin (you can type them). For more
info refer to the man page.
