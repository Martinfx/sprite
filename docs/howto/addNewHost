How to add a new host.

---  If you change this file please edit the addhost script to summarize
---  the changes.

1.  Get the new host's ethernet address and internet address.
    You can find out what these are by running `/etc/arp hostname'
    on rosemary, ginger, or envy.

2.  Run the "addhost" script.  See the man page for details.

3.  Enable TFTP booting for Suns.  Login to ginger and make a symbolic link
    in /tftpboot, using the internet address as a name, to the correct
    ndboot.sun3.??? boot file.  If a link exists, note its target.
    The internet address is in hex, i.e. 80209606 for 128.32.150.6.
    The most likely ndboot file is ndboot.sun3.pub1.  Determining this
    from first principles requires some understanding of the /etc/nd.local
    file on the file server from which the machine will be booting (ginger).
    For example, there are several 'public' nd partitions defined for ginger:
    user 0 0 /dev/xy3g 0 12880 -1
    user 0 1 /dev/xy0g 0 12880 -1
    user 0 2 /dev/xy1g 0 -1 -1
    user 0 3 /dev/xy2e 0 -1 -1
    This indicates that public partition 1 is on /dev/xy0g.  The mount table
    shows that /pub.MC68020 is mounted there.  Thus
    ndboot.sun3.pub1 will use the boot file in /pub.MC68020.

    To boot from ginger and this boot file you either have to ensure that
    only ginger has an entry in its /tftpboot directory for the host,
    or you specifically choose ginger in the boot command by puting
    the last four digits of its internet address, again in hex,
    as the second parameter to the boot argument:
    b ie(0,961c,X)		961c specifies ginger.
    The third argument is used to specify the ND partition to get
    the kernel image from.  This is an XOR function of a partition
    encoded in the ndboot file.  We keep kernel images on ginger in
    /sprite3, which is /dev/xy2e.  Again looking at the nd.local file,
    we see that this device is public ND partition 3.
    The ndboot.sun3.pub1 file specifies public ND partition 1.
    To change this to a 3, 2 must be XOR'ed in.
    The ndboot.sun3.private file specifies private ND partition 0.
    This is encoded as 0x40, with the 0x40 bit meaning private.  To change
    this to a 3, 0x43 must be XOR'ed.

    if ginger:/tftpboot file is ndboot.sun3.pub1,    b ie(0,961c,2)
    if ginger:/tftpboot file is ndboot.sun3.private, b ie(0,961c,43)

4.  Run `netroute -f /etc/spritehosts' on all important hosts (file servers).
    This ensures that the servers;  know how to talk to the new host.
    Otherwise they may ignore broadcast requests from the new host.
    Likewise for the export command for the root partition.

5.  Boot using `ie(0,961c,43)sun3' or `ie(0,961c,2)sun3', as determined
    from the ndboot file in step 3 above.  If the workstation is a ds3100,
    see point 6.

6.  For decstations:

	(First make sure the decstation is configured for thick, not thin
	 ethernet!  There is a small switch next to the ethernet connectors.
	 The green light should be lit next to the appropriate connector.
	 Stick a pin into the recessed switch to change connectors.)

    6a.  To boot off of an ultrix machine, go to dill:/sprite/mop and
         copy one of the C sources to a file based on the first 6
         letters of the new host's name.  Then edit the file to
         include the host's internet and ethernet addresses.
         Similarly, copy add_{some_host} to add_{new_host} and change
         the names within the file, then su to `owner' and run
	 add_{new_host} to get mop to respond.
    6b.  Boot the kernel with "boot -f tftp()" or "boot -f
	 tftp()kernel_name". 

7. If this is a new hostname, add it to ginger:/etc/hosts.equiv.

8. If you add a machine with a color framebuffer, add it into
    /X11/R4/lib/fbtypes.  This is only necessary till the frame
    buffer stuff is installed.
