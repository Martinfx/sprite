   Most of X11R3 is now available. In particular I compiled servers for
the sun4s and the sun3s. No new servers for ds3100s, but the ultrix Xmfb.new
server is now integrated into the rest of the world.
Note that all servers now use pseudo-devices. This should relieve ds3100
users who usually wait 2 minutes for X to start... (color ds3100 still
have a problem with the rgb database).

   Essentially all of the X11R3 clients I could gather are also compiled.
Please look in /X11R3/status for your favorite programs. If anything is
missing, just let me know. I'm still having problems with: xload and
xkill (note that a new f.kill function is available in uwm). I am NOT
planning on supporting x1tox11 or xterm!

   I would like to encourage everyone to swith to X11R3 so that X11R2 can
be phased out. OK, if you do the following, you'll be up and running R3:

1. place /X11R3/cmds.$MACHINE in your path before /sprite/cmds.$MACHINE
   and remove /X/cmds.$MACHINE
2. make sure you have no file called .xserverrc in your home directory (you
   probably haven't).
3. restructure the way you start-up X. Copy the shell script which fires-up
   all your clients into .xsetup and copy /mic/newuser/.xinitrc into your
   home directory. .xinitrc initializes the server before any window pops
   up and ends in starting the window manager and your login window. The
   login window will execute your .xsetup script to bring up all other
   clients.
4. to start X, simply type 'xinit'. That's IT!.
5. Let me know what goes wrong.

Thanks,

NB: which servers are we using?
	on sun3s:	the standard MIT distribution augmented with Sprite
			pseudo-device code.
	on sun4s:	the standard MIT distribution augmented with Sprite
			pseudo-device code.
	on ds3100:	for b/w machines the DEC server augmented with
			Sprite pseudo-device code. On color machines the
			DEC server without pseudo-device code. We have NO
			source code for any of the DEC servers!
