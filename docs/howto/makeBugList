		    How to make a Sprite bug list

Messages to the Sprite log are filed in ~Sprite/Log/log.  Messages in
the Sprite log that were specifically addressed to "bugs" are
regularly printed and gone over at a Sprite meeting.  This note tells
how to make a bug list for a Sprite meeting.


1. Go to /sprite/admin/bugs.

2. The file bugs.last contains the number of the last bug report
   covered in a meeting. Let FIRST be this number plus 1.

3. cd to ~sprite/Log/log and find what the highest number log message
is (e.g., "ls XXX* | tail -5" where XXX are the first few digits of FIRST).  
Call this number LAST.

4. Run 

  ~sprite/cmds.gen/mkbuglist FIRST LAST > /sprite/admin/bugs/bugs.new

5. Put LAST into bugs.last.

6. Check bugs.new for entries that don't merit discussion at the
meeting (e.g., announcements of fixes, bugs that are known to be
fixed, bug reports that are really pilot error).  You can optionally
try to arrange related messages to come in a group; the mkbuglist
script already tries to cluster messages with the same subject line.

7. Print bugs.new in a "two-up" format (e.g., using "enscript -2r")
and make copies for everyone who is expected to be at the meeting.

8. After the meeting, put copies of the messages from bugs.new into
bugs.archive, bugs.active, and bugs.spring as appropriate.  Most
messages will at least end up in bugs.archive, but you can again apply
the filters from step 4, plus you might want to remove messages that
were useful for discussion during the meeting but don't provide useful
long-term information.

9. Delete bugs.new.
