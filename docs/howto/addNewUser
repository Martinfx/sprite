How to add a new user (revised $Date: 91/01/03 22:06:42 $)

0.  There is now a program called `adduser', located in 
    /sprite/src/admin/adduser that automates most of this stuff.
    This list will be kept around just in case someone has to
    do it by hand.

1.  Create the home directory.  The home directory should be
    put in /user1 or /user2, and a symbolic link made from /users to that
    directory.

2.  Add the newuser to /etc/passwd.  The uid should come from the UCB
    user database.  Get it from /etc/passwd on another machine, or if
    the newuser doesn't have any other UCB accounts, login as root
    on allspice and run:

    rsh thalm -l account =bin/mkpwent /users <lastname> <group>

    but use the real lastname and group.  This program will assign
    a uid and automatically add it to the main database.  A prototype
    passwd entry will be returned.

3.  Copy /users/newuser to the new user's home directory.  (this is a
    symlink so use "update /users/newuser/." or "cp -r".)

4.  Add the new user to the sprite-users group in 
    /sprite/lib/sendmail/aliases

5.  If the new user recieves mail on another machine, create a
    .forward file in his/her home directory.  Check /usr/lib/aliases
    to make sure there isn't already a forwarding alias for the person
    there.  If there is, then remove the alias from /usr/lib/aliases
    (edit the source file in /sprite/lib/sendmail/aliases), and leave
    the .forward file instead.

6.  Create a .project file for the user's account to indicate what the
    purpose of the account is.

7.  Change the ownership on the directory and all files within
    the directory so the new user owns his/her own files.  (chown -R).

8.  Send mail so he/she knows the account is ready.
