This file lists some places in Sprite that have dependencies on the
machine type.  That is, if you are adding a new $MACHINE type, here
are some places (other than the sources) that need attention.

I. machine-dependent directories.  You must either (1) create a new
directory or (2) make a link to an existing directory.  Check for
subdirectories (e.g., /sprite/cmds/mh, /sprite/lib/lint.$MACHINE).

  /sprite/admin
  /sprite/boot
  /sprite/cmds
  /sprite/daemons
  /sprite/lib
  /local/cmds
  /local/lib
  /emacs/cmds
  /X11/R4/cmds
  /X11/R4/lib


II. Shell scripts that check the value of $MACHINE.

  /boot/bootcmds


III. System makefiles that have machine-dependent checks.

  /sprite/lib/pmake/*.mk (check both MACHINE and TM)
