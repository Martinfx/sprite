This is a short howto (get started, really) about the SparcStation PROM.
The PROM has a FORTH interpreter in it that has oodles of functions.
It has a set of environment variables that control things like
your boot path and other system parameters.

You can abort out of Sprite and enter the PROM, then return to Sprite
and not loose your system.  Honest.  You might cause your workstation
to recover with the file servers, but that should work.  Typing:

 L1-a

will abort to the monitor.  Usually the PROM monitor prompt is:

 >

You can type 'b', 'c', or 'n' to this prompt, to
reboot, continue execution (i.e. return to Sprite), or enter the
FORTH interpreter, respectively. If you type 'n', you get this prompt:

 ok

There are a zillion commands defined by the FORTH system in the PROM.

 printenv

will dump the environment variables.
You will probably see that the default boot-from is "le()vmunix"
You want to change that to "le()sun4c.md/sprite" or perhaps "le()sun4c.md/new"
You can change it with:

 setenv boot-from le()sun4c.md/sprite

You can now resume Sprite with the "go" command.

 go

If you return to the PROM monitor from Sprite again, you'll go
right into the FORTH interpreter and get the "ok " prompt in response to L1-a

Type "help" and try it out.
