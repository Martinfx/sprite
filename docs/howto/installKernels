This is a first pass at a description of how to install a new kernel.  Feel
free to add to it and make corrections as needed.

1) find out what files are checked out, if any, and make sure they're
checked in:

% cd /sprite/src/kernel
% ~sprite/cmds.gen/listRcsinfo `cat Modules` /sprite/src/lib/include

1a) make sure the dependencies are up to date:

% pmake dependall

2) install all the headers:

% pmake installhdrsall
% (cd /sprite/src/lib/include; pmake install)

3) *for each machine type*, recompile all the kernel directories:

% pmake TM=... clean
% pmake TM=...

4) install all the modules:

Move the existing .new kernels out of the way if you want to keep them.
If they are to be kept you should move the "sprite" kernel to "old",
and the "new" kernel to "sprite".  This should be done in /tftpboot
on ginger also.

% pmake TM=... install

5) make kernels in your own directory for each machine type, and test them
on as many machine types as possible, especially machines with disks.
To clean up space in /sprite/src/kernel/sprite, remove old kernels that are not
booted on any machine, nor are a default kernel.  The command "oldkernels"
(in /local/cmds) will tell you what old kernels may be removed.
Once a kernel version has been removed its source snapshot can be deleted.
Snapshots are stored in /sprite/src/kernel/Installed.


6) make kernels in /sprite/src/kernel/sprite and test them.  make sure
the version number is incremented only for the first compile.  for
example:

% pmake ds3100
% pmake NEWVERSION=FALSE sun4
% pmake NEWVERSION=FALSE sun4c
% pmake NEWVERSION=FALSE sun3

7) update kernel/sprite/versionLog to indicate what is different about
the new kernel.  

8) update the notes on the servers' consoles if necessary to say what kernel
should be booted and where the debuggable copies exist.  Updating the notes
on the servers also means checking that there aren't old misleading notes
still on the consoles.

10) Make sure the kernels get copied to ginger for debugging.  Kernels are
kept in /home/ginger/sprite/kernels.  Copies of the kernels should also
be placed in /allspiceA and /assaultA.

If space on /home/ginger/sprite is tight (as it usually is), you can
free up 15-20 MB by deleting the source snapshot for an old or broken
kernel.  The snapshots are rdist'd every night from
/sprite/src/kernel/Installed to
/home/ginger/sprite/backup/src/kernel/Installed.  To keep the snapshot
from reappearing, you must either remove it from
/sprite/src/kernel/Installed, or you can add it to the KERNEL_EXCEPT
list in /sprite/admin/distfile.
