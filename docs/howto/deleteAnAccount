How to delete an account.

1. Send mail several days in advance, warning the user that the
   account is about to disappear.

2. Make sure a dump is done just before the deletion so that if anything
   needs to be restored the latest version is available.

3. Check in /sprite/spool/mail to see if the user has any unread mail.
   If so, you should forward it to a unix machine that the user has an
   account on.

4. Remove the user from the mailing lists in /sprite/lib/sendmail/aliases.

5. Delete the user's home directory.

6. Remove the user from /etc/passwd.
