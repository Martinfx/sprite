It is quite easy to install a program on Sprite.
Finding or writing the man page is probably the
hardest part ;)  We have a 'mkmf' program that makes
it trivial to set up a makefile for a set of sources.
Put all the sources into a directory, ideally
/sprite/src/cmds/less, (unless 'less' is an AT&T program,
in which case it goes in /sprite/src/attcmds/less)
After you've collected the sources, make some
machine-type subdirectories:  sun3.md sun4.md
and then execute 'mkmf'.  It takes no arguments.
It will create a Makefile and a number of
associated .mk files  (sun3.md/dependencies.mk sun3.md/tm.mk)
and it will run 'pmake depend'.  Finally, if you
type 'pmake' you'll get parallel make.  'pmake sun3'
will create a sun3 program (which is the default if
you are executing on a sun3.) or 'pmake sun4' will
make a sun4 program.  The compiled image will be
put into sun3.md/less (or sun4.md/less) and will
be installed to /sprite/cmds.sun3 (or cmds.sun4).
You should also try to find a man page.  If you can't
find the 4.3BSD man page you can edit /sprite/lib/forms/man
(that may not be the exact name).  The man page goes into
the file 'less.man' in the source directory.  The makefile
copies it to the correct place when you 'pmake install'.

ps.  You can use this same procedure for programs under your
home directory.  You might try experimenting with the
less program there first.  Let me know if you have problems.
