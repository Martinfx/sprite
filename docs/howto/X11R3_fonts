For the X11R3 servers, all the fonts are below /X11R3/lib/fonts. The four
subdirectories contain:
	misc	: miscellaneous fonts for terminal emulators and cursors
	75dpi	: regular fonts
	100dpi	: regular fonts
	xproof	: a few special fonts for xproof (troff previewer)
	local	: special local fonts and fonts from X11R2 (and X10 ?)

All fonts are found by the server using its font path. Clients never have
anything to do with fonts (except for parsing the command arguments and
handing them to the server of course). The font path for _all_ servers is
set in the server startup script (/X11R3/cmds/Xsprite):
xset fp "/X11R3/lib/fonts/misc/md,/X11R3/lib/fonts/75dpi/md,\
/X11R3/lib/fonts/100dpi/md,/X11R3/lib/fonts/xproof/md,/X11R3/lib/fonts/local/md"
to change the font path of your server (dunno why you would want to do that)
use the "fp"/"+fp"/"fp+" options to set/append/prepend your font path. Please	
refer to the man page of xset or type "xset -help". Note that "xset q" will
inform you about your current font path (among other things).

To add new fonts:
You need the font description in BDF format (file extension .bdf). Copy the
bdf file into /X11R3/lib/fonts/local, cd to that directory, compress the
bdf files you just copied, run mkmf, finally do a pmake on a ds3100 and
on either a sun4 or a sun3 (note that sun3.md is linked to sun4.md). Your
new fonts should now be available. (If you want to create a new font
directory, please contact me or look at the symbolic links in the
misc font directory.)
