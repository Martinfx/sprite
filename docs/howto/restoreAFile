Procedure for doing a restore (Revised: $Date: 92/06/10 13:15:42 $).

0.  Summary

    /sprite/admin/restore -v [-n 6] [-r] -f /dev/rst05.nr /sprite/foobar

    This restores /sprite/foobar from tape rst05.  The -n flag specifies
    a particular dump file on the tape.  The -r flag does the restore
    relative to the current directory, rather than the original location.

1.  The first thing you need to do is find a tape that contains
    the file you want to restore.  A level zero dump is done once
    a week (usually over the weekend) and contains all the files.
    Level one dumps are done on the other days.  Each level one dump
    contains all the files that have been modified since the last
    level zero dump.

    The file /sprite/admin/dump/dumpdates contains a list of recent
    dumps.  If you have created or changed the file since the latest
    level zero, you can use a subsequent level one dump, otherwise
    you should use the most recent level zero.

    Each line in /sprite/admin/dump/dumpdates has information
    about a filesystem dump.  The first number is the tape number.
    Starting from the end of the file and working forward, find the
    tape number that corresponds to the filesystem that contains the
    file you want to restore.

    If the dump was done in the last day or two, then the tape
    that contains it may still be in the tape drive.  That is
    the first place you should look.  The tape number is written
    on the back of the tape, and should be visible when the tape
    is in the drive.

    If it is not in the drive it is probably in Evans 608-2 in the
    rack on the wall (over the map of the Middle East).

    There are two Exabyte drives, both in 608-2, attached to
    Sassafras.  The top drive usually holds the tape for the daily
    dumps.  Unless you're restoring from that tape, it's usually
    better to use the (usually empty) drive beneath it.

2.  If necessary, remove the tape that is currently in the exabyte:
    Push the button on the drive.  The green light should go out
    immediately.  The drive will whir for about 30 seconds or so, and
    then the tape will pop out.

3.  Put the dump tape into the exabyte.  Close the door.  The
    drive will emit about 30 seconds of whirring noise, and then
    the green light should come on.

4.  If you are restoring files that you do not have write permission
    for, you will need to run the restore as the super-user.

    You should login to sassafras to do the restore.  Remote login is
    fine, but you should avoid logging out until the restore is
    finished.

    Type `/sprite/admin.sun4/restore -v -f <device> <pathname>'.  

    The device names for the tape drives are /dev/rst04.nr (for the
    drive labeled "target 4") and /dev/rst05.nr ("target 5").

    The path name should be a hard, absolute path.  It should not
    contain any symbolic links.  If you specify a symbolic link, then
    the link will be restored, but not the file it points to.  Be
    especially careful about using ~ to mean your home directory.
    This is often a symbolic link in the /users directory.  You should
    use the hard path instead.

    The pathname can be a single file, a directory, or a
    regular expression.

    The -v option to restore means `verbose' and will cause the
    files to be listed as they are restored.  Once all your files
    are restored you can kill the restore process.  This is often
    convenient, since it can otherwise take several hours to scan
    to the end of the tape.

    If you want to restore a file without overwriting a current
    file of the same name, then you can use the -r option to restore.
    This will cause the leading '/' to be stripped off the restored
    files.  They will be restored relative to the current directory
    instead of root.

    There are often multiple copies of a filesystem on a tape.  If
    there is only one copy of a filesystem on a tape, then the
    restore program will know which copy to use.  But since the
    daily dumps are appended to the same tape for several days,
    there are often multiple copies of a filesystem on a tape.  In
    this case you need to tell the restore program which one you
    want to use.  You can figure out which file to use by either
    looking at the file /sprite/admin/dump/dumpdates, or by reading
    the label on the tape.  You can read the label on the tape by
    using the command `` dump -t -f <device> ''.  The file number
    is the second number on each line.  Use that argument with the
    -n option to restore to tell it which file to use.

    Here is an example.  Lets say you are using the tape drive on
    allspice and the tape is already in the drive.  When you type
    `` dump -t -f /hosts/allspice/dev/exabyte.norewind '' it prints

    The first number on each line is the tape number.  So this must
    be tape 108.  That number should also be written on the back of
    the tape, and the tape box.  The second number is the file number.
    These should be sequential numbers.  The tape label itself is the
    0th file on the tape.  /user1 is the 1st file, /mic is the 2nd, etc.
    The next number is the number of bytes the file contains.  The
    next entry is the date and time the files were dumped.

    Let's say you want to restore the file /sprite/foobar from
    the dump on July 3.  /sprite is the 6th file on the tape.
    You should use the command:

    restore -v -n 6 -f /hosts/allspice/dev/exabyte.norewind /sprite/foobar

    If you want to restore the same file from the July 4 dump then
    you should use the command:

    restore -v -n 22 -f /hosts/allspice/dev/exabyte.norewind /sprite/foobar

    The restore program will skip 22 files before invoking tar.

    When the tape drive is reading the tape the orange light next
    to the green light will be on.  When it is done reading the
    tape the orange light will go off, but the green light will
    stay on.

5.  Remove the tape, put it back in the correct box, and then put
    it back where you got it from.

    If there was a tape in the drive when you started, make sure
    you put it back when you are done.
