To make it possible to boot a sprite host from a unix machine (in this
case ginger), you must put two soft links for the host's internet address into
the unix machine's /tftpboot directory.  These links will point to the boot
program for the host.  For example, for allspice to boot from ginger, we take
its internet address, 128.32.150.27, and create the following links:

    8020961B.SUN4 -> sun4.md/netBoot
    8020961B -> sun4.md/netBoot

Each two digits of the link name correspond to the hex value of the digits
between the decimal points in the internet address.  They must be all capitals.

This means that tftpboot will download the sprite netBoot program to the host
as its boot program.  The example above is for a sun4.  For a sun3, the links
would be made to sun3.md/netBoot instead.  The kernel found by the boot
program will be relative to the /tftpboot directory.  So to boot the kernel
called "new" on a sun4 sprite host, you must find the files "netBoot" and
"new" in /tftpboot/sun4.md in order to boot "sun4.md/new."
