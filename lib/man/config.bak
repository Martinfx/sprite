#
# This is the main configuration file used by Sprite's "man" program.
# Each line contains several fields separated by spaces:
#
# First field:		Name of directory that contains man page sources.
# Second field:		Name of directory that contains formatted man pages
#			corresponding to those in source directory ("-"
#			means that no formatted versions are to be kept for
#			these man pages;  reformat each time they're needed).
# Additional fields:	Any number of keywords:  if one of these is typed
#			on the command line as a "section", then this
#			directory will be checked.  The first of these fields
#			is considered to be the official section name for the
#			directory;  it is printed in "man -k" output.
# Directories will be checked in the order they are listed here
