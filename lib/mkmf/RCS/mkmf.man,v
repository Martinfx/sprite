# A script to generate (or regenerate) the Makefile for a directory
# consisting solely of header files.
#
# We assume we were invoked from mkmf.  Parameters passed in from mkmf
# through environment variables:
#
#	MKMFDIR		directory containing prototype makefiles
#	MAKEFILE	name of makefile to create
#	SUBTYPE		additional information, telling whether this
#			is an X directory, Sprite directory, etc.
#

#
# Argument processing.  (Generalized form, even though just one flag so far.)
#
while ($#argv >= 1)

	set echo
    endif

#
# Use sed to substitute various interesting things into the prototype
# makefile. The code below is a bit tricky because some of the variables
# being substituted in can be very long:  if the substitution is passed
# to sed with "-e", the entire variable must fit in a single shell argument,
# with a limit of 1024 characters.  By generating a separate script file
# for the very long variables, the variables get passed through (to the
# script file) as many arguments, which gets around the length problem.
