This directory contains header files corresponding to those that would
be in /usr/include/sys under a UNIX system.  In several places headers
have been abbreviated to leave out information that appears to be used
only in the UNIX kernel.  As more and more programs get compiled using
this library, it will undoubtedly become necessary to add more information
to these header files.
