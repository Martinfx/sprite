The LATEX EMACS library contains two macros:  LATEX CHECK to check
that LaTeX delimiters are properly nested, and COLOR to add the
color-list arguments to SLiTeX slide and overlay environments.  To
load the library when in EMACS, you type:

   <meta-X> LOAD <escape> <TEX82>LATEX <carriage return>

After the library is loaded, you call the LATEX CHECK macro by typing:

   <meta-X> LATEX CHECK <carriage return>

This macro checks the contents of your buffer, starting at the current
pointer position, for the proper nesting of delimiters.  The following
are all the matching LaTeX delimiters checked by this macro:

          Opening      Closing
          -------      -------
          {            }
          \begin{...}  \end{...}  [the environment names must match]
          \[           \]
          \(           \)
          $            $
          $$           $$

The macro also checks that an opening math mode delimiter doesn't
appear in math mode.  For example, it allows \[ { $ $ } \] but not 
\[ $ $ \] .  Note the following limitations to this macro:

   * The argument must immediately follow a \begin or \end command,
     with no intervening spaces.

   * The macro recognizes that \{, \$ and \\[ are not delimiters.  However,
     it gets confused if you have \\ right before one of the delimiters --
     for example, if you type  \\\$ or \\\[ .  You should therefore type
     \\ \$  or  \\ \[  instead.


The COLOR macro inserts the arguments to the SLiTeX \begin{slide} and
\begin{overlay} commands.  You must give the command the list of
colors as its argument.  Thus, if the colors used are red, black and
blue, you would call the macro by typing

        <meta-X> COLOR <escape>red,black,blue<carriage return>

It doesn't matter whether or not a \begin{slide} or \begin{overlay}
command already has an argument; the current argument will be ignored
if it exists. 

This macro assumes that any color declaration outside a slide or
overlay environment is global (it ignores braces and \begin ... \end
pairs other than those delimiting slides and overlays), and that the
color in effect at the \begin{slide} or \begin{overlay} will actually
appear on that slide.  You should run LATEX CHECK to check the nesting
of delimiters before running the COLOR macro.
