\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The {\it IJCAI'91 Proceedings} will be printed using the photo-offset print
process directly from camera-ready copy furnished by the authors.  To
ensure that all papers in the {\it Proceedings} have a uniform appearance,
authors are asked to adhere to the following instructions.  
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Papers produced for IJCAI'91 using computer typesetting systems (such as
\LaTeX{} or Scribe) will be printed directly from {\bf $8$-$1/2 \times
11''$} or A4 size masters.

Print your paper using a laser or other letter-quality printer in good
condition.  (If you have a ``write-white'' laser printer you must use fonts
specifically designed for it---not fonts for ``write-black'' printers.)
{\em Do not use line printers or dot matrix printers.} Papers with poor
quality output, e.g., light or gray type, and papers that significantly
deviate from these instructions, e.g., by using 8-point fonts, will not be
included in the proceedings.

Print your paper on heavy bond white paper.  Do not fold or crease your paper.

\subsection{Typewritten Papers}

If you do not have access to a typesetting system, you can type your paper
on special, oversize forms (``large mats'') that will be reduced before
printing.

If you must type your paper, please contact
Jennifer Ballentine (+1 415 965-3721; FAX +1 415 961-7181) %%% CHANGE AS APPROPRIATE
for a supply of mats and a separate set of instructions for typing your
paper.  {\em Discard these instructions\/ {\em (which are for
computer-typeset papers only)} if you are typing your paper on large mats.}

\section{Style and Format}

%%% REMOVE IF NOT TRUE
\LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files that implement these instructions have
been placed in the \LaTeX{} style repository.  (See Appendix~\ref{latex} for
instructions on how to obtain these files.)
%%%

\subsection{General Instructions}

Print manuscripts two columns to a page, in the manner in which these
instructions are printed.  The exact dimensions for pages are:
\begin{itemize}
\item left and right margins: $.75''$,
\item column width: $3.375''$,
\item gap between columns: $.25''$,
\item top margin---first page: $1.25''$,
\item top margin---other pages: $.625''$,
\item bottom margin: $1.0''$.
\item column height---first page: $7''$.
\item column height---other pages: $9.375''$.
\end{itemize}
A format template is included with these instructions.

All measurements assume an {\bf $8$-$1/2 \times 11''$} page size.  For A4
size paper use the given top and left margins and column width,
height, and gap and modify the bottom and right margins as necessary.

Use 10-point type in a clear, readable font with 1-point leading (10
on 11).  Indent when starting a new paragraph, except after major headings.

\subsection{Title Page}

\subsubsection{Title and Author Information}

Center the title on the entire width of the page in a 14-point bold font.
Place the names of authors below the title in a 12-point bold font and
affiliations and complete addresses directly below the author names in a
12-point (non-bold) font.

Credit to a sponsoring agency appears in a footnote at the bottom of the
left column of the first page.  See the example on this page.

\subsubsection{Abstract}

Place the abstract at the beginning of the first column $3.0''$ from the
top of the page, unless that does not leave enough room for the title and
author information.  Use a slightly smaller width than in the body of the
paper.  Head the abstract with ``Abstract'' centered above the body of the
abstract in a 12-point bold font.

Abstracts should be no longer than 200 words.

\subsection{Text}
The main body of the text immediately follows the Abstract. 

\subsection{Sections}

Please note that the following section heading sizes are not the \LaTeX{}
standard.

\subsubsection{Section Headings}

Print section headings in 12-point bold type in the style shown in these
instructions.  Leave a blank space of approximately 10 points above and 8
points below section headings.

\subsubsection{Subsection Headings}

Print subsection headings in 10-point bold type.  Leave a blank space of
approximately 9 points above and 4 points below subsection headings.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection Headings}

Print subsubsection headings in 10-point bold type.  Leave a blank space of
approximately 8 points above and 3 points below subsubsection headings.

\subsubsection{Special Sections}

Arrange special sections as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[Acknowledgments:] 
The Acknowledgments section, if included, follows the main body of the text
and is headed ``Acknowledgments,'' printed in the same style as a section
heading, but without a number. 
\item[Appendices:] 
Any Appendices follow the Acknowledgments (or directly follow the text) and
look like sections, except that they are numbered with capital letters
instead of arabic numerals. 
\item[References:]
The References section is headed ``References,'' printed in the same
style as a section heading, but without a number.
A sample list of references is given at the end of these
instructions.
Use a consistent format for references, such as provided by
Bib\TeX{}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Citations}

Citations within the text should include the author's last name and
the year of publication, for example \cite{cheeseman:probability}.
Append lower case letters to the year in cases of ambiguity.
Treat multiple authors as in the following examples:
\cite{abelson-et-al:scheme} (for more than two authors) and
\cite{brachman-schmolze:kl-one} (for two authors).
If the author portion of a citation is obvious, omit it,
e.g., Levesque \shortcite{levesque:belief}.
Collapse multiple citations as follows:
\cite{levesque:functional-foundations,haugeland:mind-design}.%
\nocite{abelson-et-al:scheme}%
\nocite{brachman-schmolze:kl-one}%
\nocite{cheeseman:probability}%
\nocite{haugeland:mind-design}%
\nocite{lenat:heuristics}%
\nocite{levesque:functional-foundations}%
\nocite{levesque:belief}

\subsection{Footnotes}

Place footnotes at the bottom of the page in a 9-point font.  Refer to them
with superscript numbers.\footnote{This is how your footnotes should
appear.} Separate them from the text by a short line.\footnote{Note the
line separating these footnotes from the text.}


\section{Illustrations}

\subsection{General Instructions}

Place illustrations (figures, drawings, tables, and photographs) throughout
the paper at the places where they are first discussed, rather than at the
end of the paper.  If placed at the bottom or top of a page, illustrations
may run across both columns.  Securely attach them to the master form with
glue stick, spray adhesive, rubber cement, or white tape.  Do not use
transparent tape as the printing process blurs copy under transparent tape.

Number illustrations sequentially.  Use references of the following form:
Figure 1, Table 2, etc.  Place illustration numbers and captions under
illustrations.  Leave a margin of 1/4-inch around the area covered by the
illustration and caption.  Use 9-point type for captions, labels, and
other text in illustrations.

{\em Do not use line printer printouts in illustrations.}

\subsection{Drawings}

Draw original line drawings in {\em black ink}, not pencil.  Do not color
in drawings.  Lines should be heavy enough to reproduce clearly.

\subsection{Photographs}

Use only glossy black and white photographs.  Color photographs do not
reproduce well.  (Red will reproduce as black, for example.)  Photographs
incur extra expense, so please use them judiciously.  {\em Do not attach
photographs to the pages}---leave sufficient space for them and write
figure numbers in the space.  Label photographs on the back with the figure
number, and enclose them in a separate envelope.

\section{Length of Papers}

%%% CHANGE AS APPROPRIATE
Authors are allowed {\em six\/} (6) pages.  All illustrations and
references must be included in the 6-page allowance.  

{\em One} extra page may be included by accompanying the paper with a check
for \$250, payable to IJCAI, Inc.
Papers over seven pages will not be accepted for publication.
%%%

\section{Identification}

Type or write your name on the {\em back\/} of every page of the masters.
Number the pages sequentially.  This information is for identification only;
final page numbers will be assigned by the publisher.

\section{Mailing}

{\em Make a photocopy of your final paper.}  Keep the photocopy in your
files for reference or in case the original is lost in the mail.

Your paper (the original) must be {\em received\/} by 
Jennifer Ballentine %%% CHANGE AS APPROPRIATE
no later than 
{\bf April 20, 1991}. %%% CHANGE AS APPROPRIATE
{\em Papers received later than this date will not be included in the Proceedings.}

Do not fold your paper for mailing.  Please use the enclosed envelope for
mailing.  If you use a different envelope, mark it clearly: {\bf Do Not
Fold or Bend}.

\section{Using \LaTeX{}}\label{latex}

A \LaTeX{} style file (for version 2.09 of \LaTeX{}) that implements these
instructions has been prepared, as have a Bib\TeX{} style file (for version
0.99c of Bib\TeX{}, {\em not version 0.98i}) and a LaTeX style file that
implement the citation and reference styles in these instructions.

The relevant files have been placed in the \LaTeX{} style collection at
Clarkson.  To retrieve these files use one of the following methods:

\begin{enumerate} 
\item For Internet users - how to ftp:

Here is an example session.  Ftp syntax varies from host to
host; your syntax may be different.

\begin{verbatim}
% ftp sun.soe.clarkson.edu
Name: anonymous
Password: <any non-null string>
ftp> cd pub/tex/latex-style
ftp> get ijcai91.tex
ftp> get ijcai91.sty
ftp> get named.sty
ftp> cd ../bibtex-style
ftp> get named.bst
ftp> quit
\end{verbatim}

\item  Non-Internet users - how to retrieve by mail:

Send mail to
archive-server@sun.soe.clarkson.edu as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
To: archive-server@sun.soe.clarkson.edu
Subject:

path <your address>
send tex/latex-style ijcai91.tex
send tex/latex-style ijcai91.sty named.sty
send tex/bibtex-style named.bst
\end{verbatim}

The address you put in the message should be a valid internet path,
such as host!user@uunet.uu.net.
