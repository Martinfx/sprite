     October 1989                    - 1 -                     Introduction



     1.  INTRODUCTION
     ______________________________________________________________________

     LaTeX Letter Reference explains how to use LaTeX letter commands to
     produce letters that conform to the Los Alamos National Laboratory
     standards for correspondence.  LaTeX is a macro package that
     supplements the TeX document preparation system to streamline the
     production of many types of documents.  The LaTeX commands are put
     into a LaTeX input file and are executed when you run the file through
     LaTeX.

     Although it is not necessary to read each section in order, the later
     sections assume that you have read this introduction and, if you are
     not familiar with the local documentation, Appendix B.

     This document is divided into the following sections:

        o Section 1: Introduction.  This section is a road map of the
          document.

        o Section 2: Prerequisites for Using LaTeX Letter Commands.  This
          section tells on what systems you can use the letter commands and
          lists what you need on your system so you can implement the
          commands.  It also gives you sources for more information about
          LaTeX.

        o Section 3: Getting Started.  This section shows the general
          format for a LaTeX letter file and explains the major parts of
          the file.

        o Section 4: Preparing the Preamble Section.  This section explains
          commands that you will need in the preamble part of the LaTeX
          letter file where the opening and closing of the letter is
          defined.  This section only covers the basic letter commands
          needed for a typical letter.  See Section 7 for information about
          changing fonts and commands that give special instructions.

        o Section 5: Preparing the Document Section.  This section
          describes the part of the LaTeX letter file containing the body
          of the document.

        o Section 6: Printing Your Letter.  This section explains how to
          print a letter.  The instructions in this chapter are very
          general and are the same as the instructions for printing any
          LaTeX file.

     Introduction                    - 2 -                     October 1989



        o Section 7: Customizing Your Letter.  This section gives details
          about the special letter commands that can be put into the
          preamble section of your file to control the fonts for the
          letterhead, the fonts and typeface for the body of a letter,
          pagebreaks, classification labeling, formatting for short
          letters, producing letters for a mailing list, and printing
          mailing labels.

        o Appendix A: Summarizing the LaTeX Letter Commands.  This appendix
          is a summary table for the letter commands.  It gives a brief
          description of each command and a list of options and defaults
          where applicable.

        o Appendix B: Syntax Rules and Documentation Standards.  This
          appendix explains the rules governing the LaTeX letter commands
          and the various standards used in locally produced documentation.

        o Appendix C: Example Letters.  This appendix gives examples of
          letter files and their resulting letters.

        o Appendix D: Installing the LaTeX Style File.  This appendix
          explains how to install the letter style file on your system.

        o Appendix E: Warning and Error Messages.  This appendix contains a
          listing of all the error messages that are possible when using
          the letter commands.

        o Appendix F: Glossary of Terms and Acronyms.  Terms and acronyms
          not commonly defined elsewhere, or whose meaning are specific to
          the Los Alamos environment, are defined in this appendix.


     Several forms follow the last appendix.  If you have any comments
     about or suggestions for this document, please return them on the
     Reader Comments Form.  If you would like to order documentation
     referred to in this document, complete and return the Documentation
     Request Form to the Computing Information Center (CIC).

     2.  PREREQUISITES FOR USING LATEX LETTER COMMANDS
     ______________________________________________________________________

     This section lists the systems on which you can use LaTeX letter
     commands, the features you must have on your system, and sources for
     general information about LaTeX.


     2.1.  What You Need Before You Can Use the Letter Commands

     You can use the LaTeX letter commands when working in the following
     environments:

        o UNIX distributed processors

        o Sun and Apollo workstations

        o IBM PCs

        o VAX/VMS distributed processors


     With each of these environments, you need the following:

        o TeX and LaTeX installed

        o The LaTeX letter style file installed

        o Access to a printer that has the necessary software to print TeX
          output



            _____________________________________________________

              See Appendix D for information about installing
              the letter style file.

     October 1989                    - 5 -                  Getting Started



     3.  GETTING STARTED
     ______________________________________________________________________

     To prepare a letter with LaTeX, you first create a file with a ".tex"
     extension at the end of its name (e.g., test.tex).  This file is
     called your LaTeX letter file.  LaTeX commands are case sensitive and
     should be entered in upper- or lowercase characters as shown in this
     document or other documentation.  Note that each command begins with a
     backslash (\).

     Each LaTeX letter file has two sections:  the preamble section and the
     document section.  The preamble section contains the commands that set
     up the information for the opening and closing of the letter and
     describe the style of the letter.  It starts with a \documentstyle
     command and ends with a \begin{document} command.  The document
     section contains the text of the letter.  It starts with a
     \begin{document} command and ends with an \end{document} command.

     The general format of the preamble section of a LaTeX letter file is

            \documentstyle{laletter}

              Letter commands, such as
                \to
                \salutation
                \complimentaryclose
                 .
                 .
                 .

     The general format of the document section of a LaTeX letter file is

            \begin{document}
            \opening

              Body of letter

     4.  PREPARING THE PREAMBLE SECTION
     ______________________________________________________________________

     The preamble section of your LaTeX letter file contains the commands
     that set the opening and closing of the letter.  The preamble is
     described in two sections: this section and Section 7.  This section
     describes the letter commands that determine the opening and closing
     of a typical letter.  Section 7 describes the letter commands that you
     can use to customize your letter.

     You can print a letter using only the preamble commands covered in
     this chapter.  Notice, however, that if you use only the preamble
     commands listed in this section, your letter will be printed with a
     nonstandard Los Alamos logo.  See Section 7 for directions for
     printing a letter with the standard outline type of logo.

     The \documentstyle command is the only command required in the
     preamble section and must be the first line in your LaTeX letter file.
     The other commands can be arranged in any order within the preamble
     section.  LaTeX will print them in the proper place in the letter.


     4.1.  Defaults

     Default values are the values that LaTeX puts in when you leave a
     command out of the file.  With the default values, one of the
     following will happen:

        o The label in the header will be left blank. This happens with the
          commands that have labels printed with the letterhead - \symbol,
          \mailstop, and \telephone commands.

        o Default information will be printed.  This information is
          described with the appropriate commands.

        o Nothing will be printed.  This happens with the commands that
          have no preprinted labels on the stationery; for example, if you
          leave out the enclosure command (\enc), LaTeX will not print an
          enclosure list or the label "Enc."

        o A font or register is set to the default value.

     You may also receive a warning message if the omitted command is
     needed to conform to Laboratory correspondence standards.

            _____________________________________________________

              The backslashes (\) and the braces ({ }) in the
              following commands are a part of these commands
              and must be included with the command.  They do
              not denote optional parameters.
            _____________________________________________________



     Commands that print specific information in your letter are listed in
     this section.  Essential LaTeX commands are listed where they must be
     inserted into the preamble section.  The general commands are listed
     in the order in which the Office Procedures Manual describes them.


     4.2.  Document Style

     \documentstyle{laletter}

     This command tells LaTeX that your document is a letter.  It must be
     the first line in your file because LaTeX sets up margins and other
     values based on the style you specify inside the braces (in this case,
     a Los Alamos letter style).

     This command also sets the point size for the body of your letter.
     LaTeX uses a point size of 10, 11, or 12, with a point size of 10 as
     the default for all LaTeX documents.  The \documentstyle command, as
     it is shown above, gives your letter a point size of 10, which is
     small and may be difficult to read.  See Example 3 in Appendix C for
     an example of text with a point size of 10.  You can increase the
     point size by putting an [11pt] or [12pt] option (including the square
     brackets[]) before the {laletter} parameter.  The following example
     shows the command that gives a point size of 12 for the body of your
     letter.  (This document is printed with a point size of 12.)


       ==============================================================

       \documentstyle[12pt]{laletter}

       ==============================================================


     The \documentstyle command is a LaTeX command, and it follows the
     syntax rules for standard LaTeX commands.  See one of the LaTeX
     reference books listed in Section 2 for these syntax rules.

            _____________________________________________________

              Warning:  You can not use
              \documentstyle[10pt]{laletter} to specify a
              point size of 10.  You must leave out the point
              size if you want the default point size of 10.
            _____________________________________________________





     4.3.  Letterhead Labels

     The Laboratory has two standard styles of letterheads: one with
     callout labels printed in the upper right corner and the other with no
     printed callout labels.  To supply information for the printed callout
     labels, use the \date, \symbol, \serialnumber, \mailstop, and
     \telephone commands, which are individually described in this section.



     4.3.1.  Nocallouts

     \nocallouts

     If you do not want callout labels printed, you can use the command
     \nocallouts and then use the \date, \symbol, or \serialnumber commands
     to specify what information you want in the upper right corner.  The
     following example shows that the date will be printed without a label,
     and the symbol and serial number will be combined on the line labeled
     Ref: and printed beneath the date.


       ==============================================================

       \nocallouts
       \date { }
       \symbol {DD}
       \serialnumber {89-098}

          prints

       January 25, 1989
       Ref: DD-89-98

     4.3.2.  Date

     \date{text}

     This command inserts the date into your letter.  The {text} is the
     date you want to appear on your letter.  If you omit the text within
     the braces or omit the entire command, the default will give you the
     date at the time you run LaTeX.  This default date will appear in the
     following form:  January 25, 1989.  You should include the text with
     the \date command only if you have a specific date that you want to
     appear on your letter.  The following example shows how to have a
     specific date printed on a letter.


       ==============================================================

       \date{January 25, 1989}

            prints

       DATE:  January 25, 1989

       ==============================================================




     4.3.3.  In Reply Refer To

     \symbol{group}
     \serialnumber{id}

     These commands fill in the portion of the letterhead marked "IN REPLY
     REFER TO:".  The {group} is usually your group name.  The
     \serialnumber command is needed only if your office uses a serial
     number to identify and record its correspondence.  When used, the {id}
     should be the serial number that identifies the letter.  It will be
     appended to the symbol with a hyphen (-), as the following example
     shows.  If you leave out the \serialnumber command, the serial number
     will not be appended, and the group name will be the only information
     on the In Reply... line.

       ==============================================================




     4.3.4.  Mail Stop

     \mailstop{text}

     This command will produce the MAIL STOP line.  The {text} should be
     your mail stop.


       ==============================================================

       \mailstop{M995}

            prints

       MAIL STOP:  M995

       ==============================================================




     4.3.5.  Telephone Number

     \telephone{number}

     This command will produce the TELEPHONE line.  The number should be
     your complete telephone number including the area code.  The example
     shows how to place an FTS number on a line below your regular number.

     4.4.  Address

     \to{addressee}

     This command gives the name and address of the person to whom you are
     sending the letter.  The double backslash (\\) in {addressee}
     separates the information and starts a new line for each part of the
     address.  When you have more than one addressee, use a \to command for
     each addressee as the following example shows.  If you do not use a
     \to command, you will get a warning message when you run the file
     through LaTeX.

     \rightto{addressee}.


     4.5.  Attention Line

     \attn{name}

     You can add an attention line within the address by using the \attn
     command on any line above the street or box number.  The following
     example shows how the \attn command is inserted within the \to
     command.

     This command prints a reference line for your letter.  The {text}
     should be your reference; it will be printed in uppercase in the
     opening of the letter, directly below the subject line.  If you
     include more than one reference, the references will automatically be
     numbered.

     Notice in the example that when you have several references, you can
     separate them with double backslashes (\\) inside the braces, or you
     can place each reference on a separate command line.

     \usetoasheader            The default.  The header includes the name
                               of the addressee, the page number, the
                               date, and the group serial number.

     \useattnasheader          The name from the Attn: line is used in
                               place of the addressee's name.

     \usesubjectasheader       The subject line is printed in upper- and
                               lowercase letters instead of the
                               addressee's name.  You may want to use this
                               header if there are many addressees.

     \useotherasheader{text}   The {text}, such as Distribution, is used
                               as the header instead of the addressee's
                               name.

     4.11.  Complimentary Close

     \complimentaryclose{text}

     This command prints the text that you specify for the complimentary
     close after the body of the letter.  You must include the proper
     punctuation within the brackets.  If you do not include the
     \complimentaryclose command in the preamble section, the default

     4.13.  Initial Line-Signer, Originator, and Typist

     \signer{initials}
     \originator{initials}
     \typist{initials}

     These commands produce the identification initials, but you may omit
     the initials that do not apply to your situation.  The \signer command
     is for the initials of the signer, the \originator command is used if
     a person other than the signer drafted the letter, and the \typist
     command is for the typist of the letter.  If you leave out the \signer
     command, you will get a warning message, but this does not affect the
     printing of your letter.  The letter will print without the signer's
     initials.
     If you include all three sets of initials, they will be arranged on
     the initial line as the following example shows.

     4.14.  Enclosures

     \enc{list}
     \encas

     You can use either the \enc or the \encas command to print the
     enclosure line.  The \enc{list} command is used when you have several
     enclosures with your letter that have not been specifically referred
     to in the body of the letter.  The {list} is the list of your
     enclosures with a double backslash (\\) separating the items.  The
     enclosure list is automatically numbered as shown in the following
     example

     This command prints a numbered list of attachments for your letter.
     The {list} is the list of attachments, and, as the example shows, the
     items should be separated with a double backslash (\\) inside the
     braces.

     \cy{list}
     \distribution{list}

     Either of these commands gives a list of the people to whom
     informational copies of your letter will be sent.  The \cy{list}
     command prints the list with the first line beside a Cy:, and the
     \distribution{list} command prints the list beneath a Distribution:
     line.  The {list} is the list of people to whom copies should be sent.
     The names are separated with a double backslash (\\), as shown in the
     following example.

     Preparing the Document Section  - 22 -                    October 1989



     5.  PREPARING THE DOCUMENT SECTION
     ______________________________________________________________________

     This chapter describes the commands that go into the document section
     of your letter.  The document section is the second main section in
     your LaTeX letter file and follows immediately after the preamble
     section.  It starts with a \begin{document} command, ends with an
     \end{document} command, and contains the commands and text that
     produce the body of the letter.


            _____________________________________________________

              The following letter commands must be in every
              letter file in the order in which they are
              presented.
            _____________________________________________________



     \begin{document}

     This command signals the beginning of your document.  All of the
     preamble commands should be placed before this command in your file.

     \opening

     This command uses the information from the preamble commands to print
     the opening of your letter.  All of the preamble commands that supply
     information for the opening of your letter must appear before this
     command.  LaTeX will ignore or give an error message for any opening
     preamble commands that are encountered after the \opening command.

     Body of Letter

     The body of your letter comes after the \opening command.  You can use
     any of the standard LaTeX commands inside the body to control the
     appearance of the text.

     \closing

     The \closing command comes after the body of your letter and tells
     LaTeX to print out the closing information for your letter.  It uses
     commands and information entered in the preamble section of your file.
     All preamble commands must be placed before the \begin{document}
     command.

     \end{document}

     The last line of your file must be the \end{document} command.  This
     line tells LaTeX that you are finished with your document, and LaTeX
     will ignore anything after this command.

     6.  PRINTING YOUR LETTER
     ______________________________________________________________________

     Once you have finished creating your letter file with the letter
     commands in it, follow these steps to print your letter.


            _____________________________________________________

              These steps are the same steps you use to print
              any LaTeX file.
            _____________________________________________________




     (1)  Run your file through LaTeX by typing

            latex filename.tex

          where filename.tex is the name of your letter file.

          If you have any error messages, they will appear on the screen
          during execution.  These error messages are interactive and will
          wait for you to respond to the
          ? (question mark) prompt.  You can type another question mark (?)
          at the prompt to display a list of your options at that point.
          You will also get a file called filename.log that contains the
          error messages that were produced.  See
          Appendix E for more information about error messages.

          When LaTeX ends execution successfully, you will receive a
          message that the filename.dvi file is created, and you can
          proceed to the next step in printing your letter.  (Occasionally,
          however, you may receive a message that a .dvi file has been
          created when only a partial file has been created.  If this
          happens, you probably have an error at the point where the
          partial .dvi file ends.)  When an error occurs, you must correct
          your error and run your file through LaTeX again before you can
          print the letter.

          If you have trouble running LaTeX, call the Consulting Office or
          see one of the LaTeX publications mentioned in Additional
          Information in Section 2.


     (2)  If your computer has a program that will allow you to preview
          .dvi files, you should preview your filename.dvi file now and
          make any necessary corrections.  If your computer cannot preview
          .dvi files, go on to the next step.

     Printing Your Letter            - 24 -                    October 1989



     (3)  Print out your filename.dvi file by using the correct procedures
          for your computer.  If you need help with the printing, you
          should contact your local system manager if you are using a
          workstation or distributed processor, or you can call the
          Consulting Office if you are using a C-Division computer.

          If you want to send your output to one of the PAGES raster
          printer-plotter devices, you can use a utility called DVIPAGES.
          This utility can be used for unclassified output from the UNIX
          distributed processors Alpha and Beta or from the VAX/VMS
          distributed processors.  For more information about this utility,
          see DVIPAGES: TEX DVI to PAGES Quick Steps.  You can order this
          document from the CIC by using the Documentation Request Form in
          the back of this document.


            _____________________________________________________

              At the present time, DVIPAGES cannot handle
              secret or confidential letters.

     October 1989                    - 25 -         Customizing Your Letter



     7.  CUSTOMIZING YOUR LETTER
     ______________________________________________________________________

     This chapter describes special letter commands that you can put into
     the preamble section of your file to customize your letter.  These
     commands must be placed before the \begin{document} command in your
     file.


     7.1.  Header Style

     The header for a letter includes the Los Alamos logo and address, plus
     the optional callout labels.  You can choose from four header styles.
     Three of these header styles use fonts that print a header on plain
     paper, and the other header style allows you to use the preprinted
     stationery provided by the Laboratory.  The following table lists the
     commands for the different header styles.


     Command                     Results

     _________________________   __________________________________________

     \headerfonts{texfonts}      This is the default header style because
                                 these fonts (Computer Modern) are
                                 available on all computers with LaTeX and
                                 TeX.  It gives a header similar to the
                                 standard letterhead but with a solid Los
                                 Alamos logo.

     \headerfonts{lafonts}       This command gives the Laboratory's
                                 standard letterhead with an outline style
                                 logo, but these fonts are not installed on
                                 all computers.

     \headerfonts{postscript}    This command gives a header similar to the
                                 standard letterhead with an outline style
                                 logo.  These fonts can be used with
                                 PostScript printers only.

     \headerfonts{letterpaper}   This command allows you to use preprinted
                                 stationery.  It suppresses the printing of
                                 the header.  (See Section 7.6 for more
                                 information.)

     Customizing Your Letter         - 26 -                    October 1989



            _____________________________________________________

              The examples in Appendix C show what each of
              these header styles produces.
            _____________________________________________________



     To use the lafonts for letters, you need four special fonts named
     book6, book7, la28, and spec12.  These fonts are part of the PCTeX
     distribution for IBM PCs.  For the VMS and UNIX systems, you can get
     the fonts from the following files on the Common File System (CFS):

        o /TEX/FONTS/MEMO_LETTER.BCK for VMS systems

        o /TEX/FONTS/MEMO_LETTER.TAR for UNIX systems

     For more information, see TeX Fonts for Los Alamos Memos and Letters
     Installation Reference, which can be ordered from the CIC by using the
     Documentation Request Form in the back of this document.  If you have
     questions about the lafonts, call the Consulting Office.

     The PostScript fonts are available for PostScript printers in a
     program called DVIPS.  DVIPS is available on the distributed
     processors Alpha and Beta.  The VAX/VMS version is available on CFS as
     /TEX/DEVICE_DRIVERS/DVIPS8901.BCK.  For Sun and Apollo workstations,
     you can purchase the DVIPS program from the CIC.  DVIPS for an IBM PC
     can be purchased from MEC-9.


     7.2.  Body Style

     This section describes the commands that affect the body of your
     letter.


     7.2.1.  Type Style

     The body of your letter can be printed in typewriter type or
     proportionally spaced Roman type.  You can specify the type style by
     putting one of the following commands in your preamble section:

     October 1989                    - 27 -         Customizing Your Letter



     Command           Results

     _______________   _____________________________________________

     \typeface{tt}     Gives typewriter type.  (This is the
                       default.)

     \typeface{rm}     Gives proportionally spaced Roman type.


     The typeface default is typewriter type because letters are
     traditionally typed with typewriters.  See Appendix C for examples of
     the typewriter and Roman typefaces.


     7.2.2.  Fonts

     You can also pick different fonts for the body of your letter.  The
     following table lists your choices for the body fonts.


     Command                  Results
     ______________________   ________________________________________

     \bodyfonts{texfonts}     This is the default body font because
                              these fonts are available on all
                              computers with LaTeX and TeX.

     \bodyfonts{postscript}   These fonts can be used only with
                              PostScript printers.


     The Computer Modern fonts come with TeX and are on all systems that
     have TeX and LaTeX installed.  The PostScript fonts, for use with a
     PostScript printer, require the DVIPS program mentioned in Section
     7.1.  See Appendix C for examples of these body fonts.


     7.2.3.  Margin Space

     You can adjust both the top and side margins of your letter.  The
     default side margin of a letter is defined by the edges of the
     letterhead.  The top margin space (the space between the letterhead
     and the address) is usually four vertical spaces.  The {amount} for
     the margin space commands can be expressed in inches (in), centimeters
     (cm), points (pt), picas (pc), or millimeters (mm).  A positive value
     increases the {amount}, and a negative value decreases it.  You can
     change the top and side margins of your letter with the following
     commands where {amount} is the total change:

     Customizing Your Letter         - 28 -                    October 1989



     Command                    Results
     ________________________   _____________________________________

     \expandwidth{amount}       Increases or decreases the width of
                                the text to change the side margin.
                                The {amount} is split between the
                                left and right sides.

     \expandtopmargin{amount}   Increases or decreases the distance
                                between the letterhead and the
                                address.



     7.3.  Classification Labels

     The following commands can be used to print a secret, confidential, or
     unclassified label on your letter.


     Command           Results
     _______________   _____________________________________________

     \classlabel{ }    The default.  It does not print a label on
                       the letter.

     \classlabel{u}    Prints a label that says UNCLASSIFIED.

     \classlabel{c}    Prints a label that says CONFIDENTIAL.

     \classlabel{s}    Prints the SECRET label.


     These commands print the appropriate label at the top and bottom of
     the letter in heavy black print.  You can use them for labeling a
     classified letter, but we suggest that you use the more visible red-
     stamped classification labeling on the front and back of the paper
     instead of using these commands.


            _____________________________________________________

              The LaTeX letter commands will not print a red
              label and will not print any label on the back
              of the paper.

     7.4.  Page Breaks

     This section describes the commands that you can use to control the
     page breaks in your letter.


     7.4.1.  General Page Breaks

     \newpage

     The LaTeX command \newpage breaks for a new page at the place where
     you use this command.  You can put the command anywhere in the body of
     your letter or inside the brackets of a letter command.

     The following example shows the \newpage command within the brackets
     of another command.  It divides the list between the second and third
     name, with the first two names appearing on the current page of the
     letter and the third name appearing on the next page.


       ==============================================================

       \cy{A. B. Cog \\ C. D. Man
               \newpage \\ E. F. Barr}

            prints on separate pages

       A. B. Cog                    E. F. Barr
       C. D. Man

       ==============================================================




     7.4.2.  Page Break Before a List

     If, after printing your letter, you find that some of the lists in the
     closing section are broken between pages, you can use the following
     commands to start the list at the top of the next page.  You can put
     these commands anywhere in the preamble section of your file.

     Command                  Results
     ______________________   __________________________________________

     \cypagebreak             Starts the copy list at the top of the
                              next page.
     \attachmentspagebreak    Starts the list of attachments at the top
                              of the next page.
     \distributionpagebreak   Starts the distribution list at the top of
                              the next page.
     \encpagebreak            Starts the list of enclosures at the top
                              of the next page.



     7.5.  Short Letters

     \shortletterstyle

     For short letters of ten or fewer lines, the Office Procedures Manual
     recommends a modified block style.  The short letter style has double
     spaced lines and indented paragraphs.

     To produce this type of letter, add the \shortletterstyle command to
     the preamble section of your file.  If you use this short letter style
     and the body of your letter is over one page long, you will get a
     warning message when you run LaTeX.  See Appendix C for an example of
     a short letter style.


     7.6.  Preprinted Stationery

     You can use Laboratory stationery with the preprinted header on it by
     including the following command in the preamble section of your file:

       \headerfonts{letterpaper}

     This command prints your header information next to the preprinted
     labels. However, the information may not line up correctly with the
     labels on the stationery because of the different types of printers.
     If your printer is not lining up the information correctly, put the
     following commands in the preamble section of your file to shift the
     printed information and correct the problem.

       \letterpaperhcorr{distance}
       \letterpapervcorr{distance}

     The \letterpaperhcorr command corrects the horizontal positioning, and
     the \letterpapervcorr command corrects the vertical positioning.  The
     {distance} parameter is the amount the text must be moved and can be
     an integer or decimal number.  The {distance} can be expressed in
     inches (in), centimeters (cm), points (pt), picas (pc), or millimeters
     (mm), and it can be a positive or negative value.

     October 1989                    - 31 -         Customizing Your Letter



     When you want to adjust the printing horizontally (using
     \letterpaperhcorr), a positive distance moves the printed material to
     the right, and a negative distance moves the print to the left.  When
     you want to adjust the printing vertically (using \letterpapervcorr),
     a positive distance moves the printed material down on the page, and a
     negative distance moves the print up on the page.

     The following table shows the effect of each command in adjusting the
     printing.  The n's indicate a number, and the u's indicate the
     abbreviation for the unit of measure (e.g., in for inches).


     Command                  Results
     ______________________   ________________________________________

     \letterpaperhcorr{+nu}   Moves text to the right
     \letterpaperhcorr{-      Moves text to the left
     nu}
     \letterpapervcorr{+nu}   Moves text down on the paper
     \letterpapervcorr{-      Moves text up on the paper
     nu}


     The following example will move the printed material of the letter to
     the right 1 inch and up 2 inches.


       ==============================================================

       \letterpaperhcorr{1in}
       \letterpapervcorr{-2in}

       ==============================================================




            _____________________________________________________

              If you routinely use the same printer to print
              letters on preprinted stationery, you can figure
              out what distances line up the text properly for
              your printer and use those distances for each
              letter.  You must include these commands in each
              letter file.

     7.7.  Multiple Letters to a Mailing List

     With LaTeX letter commands, you can send a personalized letter to each
     person on a mailing list.  The file for multiple letters is set up
     differently from the file for single letters.  The \to command is
     placed in the document section of the letter rather than in the
     preamble section.  The body of the letter is put into a file by itself
     and called by the letter file for each individual address.  Following
     is a general format for a multiple-letter file, in which BODYFILE.TEX
     is the name of the file that contains the body of the letter.
            \documentstyle{laletter}

              Letter commands, such as
                   \mailstop
                   \complimentaryclose
                    .
                    .

           \input{bodyfile.tex}
           \closing

           \end{document}

     It is also possible to change the salutation for each letter by
     putting a \salutation command after each \to command.


     7.8.  Mailing Labels

     You can print mailing labels with the LaTeX letter commands by putting
     the following command into the preamble section.

          \makemaillabels

     When you use this command, sheets of mailing labels will be printed
     after the letters have been printed.  The default will produce labels
     in two columns, each with seven
     1 1/2- by 4-inch labels, suitable for reproducing onto Avery brand
     number 5362 address labels.

     An easy way to print mailing labels is to print them onto ordinary
     paper and use a copy machine to transfer the addresses onto the sheets
     of mailing labels.  If you are running mailing-label paper through a

     laser printer or a copy machine, be sure to use paper suitable for a
     laser printer.


     7.8.1.  Return Address Labels

     You can have labels printed with a return address by putting the
     following line into the preamble section.

          \returnaddress{text}

     Your address is the {text} for the \returnaddress command.  The format
     for the {text} is the same as used for the \to command.


     7.8.2.  Label Size

     You can print labels on different sizes of mailing labels, as long as
     they are arranged in two columns on an 8 1/2- by 11-inch piece of
     paper.  To indicate a specific size of mailing label, use these
     commands:

          \maillabelheight{amount}
          \maillabeltopmargin{amount}

     The {amount} for \maillabelheight indicates the height of each mailing
     label.  The default is 1.5 inches.

     At the top of a sheet of mailing labels, you will usually find a
     narrow strip of paper that is not used for printing.  The {amount} for
     \maillabeltopmargin indicates the distance from the top of the sheet
     of labels down to the top of the first label.  The default is 0.25
     inch.

     The following example shows you how to print 1-inch labels that begin
     1/2 inch down from the top of the sheet.


       ==============================================================

       \maillabelheight{1in}
       \maillabeltopmargin{.5in}

       ==============================================================


     You may find that some printers do not accurately measure an inch.  If
     the printing is not centered properly, try adjusting the values of
     \maillabelheight and \maillabeltopmargin.  A very small adjustment
     will often fix the problem.

     7.8.3.  Skipping Labels

     When you have a sheet of mailing labels with some labels peeled off,
     you can use the command \skiplabels{number} in the preamble section to
     specify the number of missing labels and start the printing at the
     correct spot.  In the following example, four labels will be skipped
     in column one, and the printing will start on the fifth label in that
     column.


       ==============================================================

       \skiplabels{4}

       ==============================================================




     7.8.4.  The .MLB File

     As part of the process of printing mailing labels, a temporary file
     with the suffix .mlb is created.  You can remove filename.mlb after
     LaTeX has finished running.


     7.9.  Floats in LaTeX Letters

     The LaTeX figure and table environments can be used in LaTeX letters.
     (See LaTeX: a Document Preparation System, by Leslie Lamport, for more
     information about the special environments.)  To avoid splitting a
     table or figure, LaTeX floats these environments to a convenient place
     in the document.

     In the figure and table environments, optional placement arguments can
     be included within square brackets. The arguments place the
     environment at a specified place on the page, if possible.


      Argument    Results

     __________   __________________________________________________
        [h]       Places the environment at the current line (here).

        [b]       Places the environment at the bottom of the page.

        [t]       Places the environment at the top of the page.

        [p]       Places the environment on a separate page.

     October 1989                    - 35 -         Customizing Your Letter



     Some of the placement options can cause problems, so you should be
     aware of how they can interact with the opening and the closing of the
     letter.  The [t] option places the float at the top of a page, so if
     it is used on page one, the float will be placed above the letterhead.
     If no square brackets ([ ]) are used, the placement default is [tbp]
     and can place the environment above the letterhead if it is used on
     the first page.

     Figure and table environments on the last page of text can also lead
     to undesirable results.  The last figure or table can end up on a
     separate page followed by the closing and signature on an additional
     page.  Be sure to use the [h] option for any floating environments on
     the last page and check that none of the tables and figures printed on
     the last page have floated in from a previous page.  The use of the
     [h] will usually make it possible for the end of the letter body and
     the closing to be printed on the same page.

     Syntax and Conventions          - 40 -                    October 1989



     APPENDIX B.  SYNTAX RULES AND DOCUMENTATION CONVENTIONS
     ______________________________________________________________________


     B.1.  Syntax Rules

     The following syntax rules apply to the LaTeX letter commands:

        o Commands in the preamble section are not order dependent.  That
          is, you can specify them in any order.

        o Spaces before and after braces ({ }) are ignored.

        o You can continue a command over multiple lines.  However, you
          should split the line at a space.

        o You can specify only one preamble command per line.

        o You can separate fields inside the braces ({ }) by a double
          backslash (\\), or you can repeat the command with new
          information inside the braces.


     Note that these rules do not apply to the standard LaTeX commands (for
     example, \documentstyle, \begin{document}, and \end{document}).


     B.2.  Documentation Conventions

     The following standards and conventions are used in C-Division
     publications.

        o The italicized characters are symbolic names that you must
          replace with a name or value.

        o Filenames are written in uppercase characters.

        o Square brackets ([]) denote optional input.

        o To enter a command at a terminal, you must end the line with a
          return (or end-of-line keystroke) to send the command to the
          computer.  In most cases, the return is not shown in the command
          line or example; in others it is shown as <RETURN>, which
          indicates pressing the key marked return or its equivalent.

        o Examples show exactly what you type and are always shown enclosed
          with double lines.

     APPENDIX C.  EXAMPLE LETTERS
     ______________________________________________________________________

     This appendix contains examples of letters that have been created with
     the LaTeX letter commands.  The examples show the four types of
     headers that are available for letters, as well as some of the various
     combinations of body fonts and typefaces.  The body of each letter
     explains what features to notice about that particular letter.  In
     each example, you will see the LaTeX source file that produced the
     letter, followed by the resulting letter.

     The size of the actual example letters is reduced for display
     purposes.

     \begin{document}
     \opening
     This example shows what a typical letter might look like.  It uses
     the lafonts option for the header and the texfonts option for the
     body of the letter.  The body has the typewriter typeface with a
     point size of 12.  This letter has no printed callout labels in the
     upper right corner.

     Remember that LaTeX interprets a blank line as the start of a new
     paragraph, and that any of the special characters \#,\$,\%,
     \&, \{, and \} must be preceded by a backslash.  To produce double
     quotes in typewriter typeface, use the " key on your keyboard.

     The spacing and indentation of the preamble commands make the
     file easier to read; the outcome of your file is not affected.
     The preamble section begins with the $\backslash$documentstyle
     command and continues to the $\backslash$begin\{document\}
     command where the document section starts.

     I hope this sample letter will help you produce letters with LaTeX.

     This letter is in the short-letter format.  It was printed with a
     PostScript printer using PostScript fonts for both the header and
     the body.  The print defaulted to a point size of 10.  The
     classification label is printed in black on only the front of the page.

     Notice how to input a sentence that ends in an uppercase letter, such
     as a sentence about CFS\@.  This TeX procedure gives the correct
     space when a period follows an uppercase letter.  Also notice the
     $\backslash$date command is included so that the date will appear
     as January 25, 1989, even though that date is not the date at the time

     This letter was printed on preprinted stationery.  Notice that the
     $\backslash$letterpaperhcorr and $\backslash$letterpapervcorr commands
     are used to line up the information with the labels.  The body font
     is the PostScript font, and the typeface is in Roman type.
     Emphasized text (like {\em this}) is printed in italics.

     Notice that you can use the equation formatting that TeX and LaTeX
     are known for.  This feature is useful if your letters contain
     equations like \[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac} } {2a} \]

     You can also use tables like the following:

     \begin{tabular} {c c c c c}
     \sl Year & \sl Simple Interest & \sl Annual Comp. &
     \sl Daily Comp. & \sl Continuous\\
     0 & 5000.00 & 5000.00 & 5000.00 & 5000.00\\

     Input Text File (BODYFILE.TEX)

     This is an example of a letter that can be sent to individuals on a
     mailing list.  Each letter has a unique address and greeting, but the
     text is identical for all the letters.
     The individual addresses are entered in your LaTeX letter file, and
     the body of the letter is placed in a separate file that is called for
     each letter by the $\backslash$input command.  A mailing label and a
     return address label are printed for each letter.

     Other features in this letter are
     \begin{itemize}
       \item The date is specified so all letters will have the same date
             no matter when they are run through LaTeX.
       \item The header is done with PostScript fonts, and the body is
             done with the Computer Modern fonts in a point size of 11.
       \item The enclosures appear in a numbered list.

     October 1989                    - 49 -       Installing the Style File



     APPENDIX D.  INSTALLING THE LATEX LETTER STYLE FILE
     ______________________________________________________________________

     The LaTeX letter style file must be installed on your computer before
     you can use the LaTeX letter commands.  If you are not sure if the
     style file has been installed, check with your system manager.  If you
     are responsible for installing the style file, this appendix gives you
     the information you need.


            _____________________________________________________

              This appendix assumes you already have TeX and
              LaTeX running on your system.
            _____________________________________________________



     This appendix describes the procedures for finding the instructions
     for installing the LaTeX letter style file on these computers:

        o IBM PC

        o Sun workstation

        o Apollo workstation

        o VAX/VMS

        o VAX/UNIX

     To install the letter style file on all of the above systems except
     the IBM PC, you need to be a validated user of the Los Alamos
     Integrated Computing Network (ICN).  You must also be familiar with
     the GET command of the CFS utility and with the NTEXT utility.


            _____________________________________________________

              For more information about the CFS utility, see
              the Common File System CFS Interface Reference
              manual.  For more information about the STEXT
              and NTEXT utilities, see the STEXT and NTEXT
              Reference. You can order these documents with
              the Documentation Request Form in the back of
              this document.
            _____________________________________________________



     You will be using the following files in the installation procedures;
     they are stored on CFS and are in standard text format.

     Installing the Style File       - 50 -                    October 1989



        o README.STD-tells you where to find the letter style file and
          includes installation instructions.  For VMS, this file is named
          LATEXLETTER.STD.

        o LALETTER.STY-the style file that is used when you run LaTeX on
          your letter input file.

        o LETTEST.TEX-a test letter that you can use to see if you have
          installed the letter style file correctly.

     A commented version of the LALETTER.STY file, LALETTER.DOC, is
     available on CFS.  If you want to make your own changes to the
     LALETTER.STY file, you will find this commented version useful.  Check
     the README.STD file for the CFS pathname for LALETTER.DOC.

     D.1.  On the IBM PC

     You can purchase a diskette from MEC-9 that has the LANL letter style
     file on it.  The diskette is called TeX Files for LANL.  It contains
     the LaTeX memo and letter style files, as well as LANL's memo and
     letter fonts.  The file LALETTER.DOC is not included on the MEC-9
     diskette, but it can be found on CFS.  The file named README.LA will
     show you how to use the installation script that is also on the
     diskette.

     If you prefer to get the letter style file from CFS, you can find out
     about the installation procedure for your IBM PC with the following
     steps:

       1.   >From your PC, sign on to the ICN computer of your choice by
            using VTERM or some other communications software.

       2.   While on the ICN computer,

              Use the CFS utility GET command to retrieve the following
              file from CFS:

                /tex/macros/c-2/latexletter/ibmpc/readme.std

              Use the NTEXT utility to convert README.STD to native text
              format.

              Look in the NTEXTed README.STD file to find the complete
              installation instructions.

     October 1989                    - 53 -      Warning and Error Messages



     APPENDIX E.  WARNING AND ERROR MESSAGES
     ______________________________________________________________________

     You can receive two types of error messages when running your letter
     file through LaTeX-error messages from doing something wrong with the
     letter commands and error messages from doing something wrong with the
     standard LaTeX commands.  The error messages that come from standard
     LaTeX commands are interactive and are explained in the chapter titled
     "LaTeX Errors" in An Introduction to LaTeX by Michael Urban.  The
     error messages that come from the letter commands are not interactive,
     and the fatal error messages will cause LaTeX to abort.  The letter-
     command error messages are listed below.

     E.1.  Warning Messages

     The following are warning messages that you might receive when using
     the LaTeX letter commands.  These messages remind you that you might
     be leaving something important out of your letter; they do not affect
     the printing of your letter.


     E.1.1.  Leaving Out Information

     These warning messages occur if you leave out one of the letter
     commands.  Omitting the \signer command leaves the signer's initials
     out of the initial line.  When the \complimentaryclose command is not
     used, the default \complimentaryclose{Sincerely yours,} will be used.
     Leaving out the other commands mentioned in these warning messages
     causes one of the letterhead labels at the top of the letter to be
     left blank.


       Warning: you have not called \salutation before calling \opening.

                For example, use

                \salutation{Dear Henry,}

       Warning: you have not called \complimentaryclose before calling
                \opening.  \complimentaryclose{Sincerely Yours,} will be used
                by default.


       Warning: you have not called \signature before calling \opening.

                For example, use

                \signature{Betty J. Donaldson}

     Warning and Error Messages      - 54 -                    October 1989



       Warning: you have not called \signer before calling \opening.

                For example, use

                \signer{BJD}


       Warning: you have not specified an address before calling \opening.

                Use \to to specify an address, for example

                \to{Vieno Severi Alanne \\
                414 Rio Seco \\
                Santa Fe, NM 87501}

       Warning: you have not specified the callout \symbol
                before calling \opening.

                For example, use

                \symbol{C-2}


       Warning: you have not specified the callout \mailstop
                before calling \opening.

                For example, use

                \mailstop{B253}

       Warning: you have not specified the callout \telephone
                before calling \opening.

                For example, use

                \telephone{(505) 665-0859}


       Warning: you have called \serialnumber, but you have not called
                \symbol.

                For example, use

                \symbol{C-2}

         not support these fonts.

     callout labels
         Preprinted labels that identify information printed in the letter
         head.  Labeled information includes the date and the originating
         group's name, correspondence identification number, mailstop, and
         telephone number.

     CFS (Common File System)
         The Los Alamos centralized filing system that has virtually
         unlimited storage space.

     CIC (Computing Information Center)
         The CIC is the distribution center for software and for
         documentation describing the computers, operating systems, and
         software available at Los Alamos.

     CM (Computer Modern) fonts
         The fonts that are included with the current version of TeX.
         These fonts have replaced the Almost Modern (AM) fonts.

     default
         The value or option that is used when no value or option is
         explicitly given.

     document section
         The second section of a LaTeX letter file.  It contains the
         commands and text the produce the body of the letter.

         ICN through the XNET gateway.  The distributed processor supports
         interactive terminal access to the ICN.

     DVI file
         The device-independent output file that TeX produces.  This file
         cannot be printed directly on any printer but must be converted
         into a format that your printer can understand.  A device driver
         that is compatible with your printer performs this conversion.

     font
