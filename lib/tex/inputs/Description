This file describes most of the TeX style files stored in the Software
Warehouse (/usr/sww/lib/tex/inputs).  Most of the style files on the
SWW come from the TeX style archive server at Clarkson U.
(sun.soe.clarkson.edu).  This file is a lightly edited concatenation
of the "Description" files found in the style directories there.

There are four sections that reflect the organization of the Clarkson
archive.  The sections describe the styles for LaTeX, TeX, AmsTeX, and
BibTeX, in that order.
