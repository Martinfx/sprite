% A footnote-numbering style from Brian T. Schellenberger.  v1.0.
% This is redistributable by anybody to anybody for any price.
% I only ask that you credit me for it, and that if you make any
% changes and distribute them to anybody else at all, you (1) send
% them back to me, and (2) note who made them so that any different
% versions of this floating around may be distinguished.

% The first think here is my begin definitions environment.  It is
% an environment for programming, and is seperate from the footnote-
% related stuff.  I find it convenient, and it is needed for my other
% code to work.  I also use symbolic names for all catcodes in my 
% programming, but I've gotten that out of this code for greater ease
% of use by the great wide world out there.

% The footnote code itself.
% 1. This code resets foot notes on each page.  It needs two passes
%    to do this correctly, although it comes as close as possible on
%    the first pass.  You generally make two passes with LaTeX anyway,
%    to get cross-references right, so this shouldn't be a problem.
%    It uses the aux file like everything else.
% 2. It also uses the \fnsymbol to "number" the footnotes.  This is
%    controlled by the first line of \newfoots.
% 3. It gets rid of the usual footnote rule, and inserts more vertical
%    space for footnotes.  This is also easy to see/control in the
%    \newfoots command.
% 4. Most of this code simply makes the "new" footnotes stuff available;
%    you can include all of this except the last line in a style file
%    and only say \newfoots if you want them, or you include it all
%    and say \restorefoots for the files where you don't want it.
% 5. \restorefoots and/or \newfoots are only guarenteed to work right
%    in the preamble.
% 6. I don't think I depend on anything funny in LaTeX, but in case
%    this falls apart totally, I am running the 29-Apr-87 LaTeX.

%----definitions: within \begin{definitions} (which does not really define
%    a group), spacing means nothing.  Use \space for a space character
%    and \par for a blank line, for those rare instances where they are
%    really desired.  Also, @ is seen as a letter.  All these are reversed
%    and \end{definitions}---\E{even if} they had the same catagories before!
%    These should not be nested but, unfortunately, there is no way to tell.
