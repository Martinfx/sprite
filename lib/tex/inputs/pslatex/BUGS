BUG List
--------

17 May 88	aftopl: fixed width fonts:
		spaces were 1.1x wider than other characters,
		extraspace was space/3

18 May 88	Added \@dononsf to convert \registered, etc, back
		within \rm, \bf, etc.  Fixed bug in \@getfam which was
		expanding the \CMND parameter.

26 May 88	Accent characters \' \` and \= did not work within
		certain environments due to reassignment.  Added
		assignments to \@acci \@accii and \@acciii in
		pslplain.tex.

27 May 88	\em didn't work in italic; incorrect calculation of
		SLANT in aftopl.

5 Sep 88	Bug in mk-sc: wasn't appending ";" at end of lines for
		lower-case letters.
		Also: aftopl was ignoring the fact that smallcaps
		fonts don't ligature fi and fl.  The AFM files were
		right, but aftopl added the LIGs anyway (reported by
		Nick North).

18 Oct 88	Bug in \_ and \AA; no space between the final digit
		and the closing right brace (Alasdair Rawsthorne).

8 Dec 88	Bug in \vec; wrong value of mathaccent being used (7,
		not 0) (Ralf Kneuper, via Graham Gough).

11 Feb 89	\frtnsl mistyped as \frntsl.

6 Jul 89	Added \@fixf to ensure that font switches within
		mathmode left the "f" in the right font (John
		Fitzgerald). 

31 Aug 89	Use of \a' \a` \a= in tabbing environments didn't work
		(Jon Warbrick).

3 Oct 89	Use of \$ in non-math mode swallowed up a following
		space (Robert Brown).
