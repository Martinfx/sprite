The files in this directory constitute the distribution of PSLaTeX, a
set of extensions and changes to LaTeX to make it PostScript-based.

Before beginning, you need to obtain a set of TFM files for the fonts
resident in the PostScript device you intend to use.  (The default
configuration assumes you have the "standard" 13 fonts, namely the
Times, Courier, Helvetica and Symbol families.)  A set of these files
is distributed as part of the standard UNIX TeX distribution.
Additionally, they can be found on the Aston TeX archive server in the
UK, and on june.cs.washington.edu in the US.  You will probably need
to do a little work on these fonts before they can be used with
PSLaTeX; see the section below.  If you were using an old version of
PSLaTeX, then the fonts that you used with that will be fine.  As a
last resort, a set of ready-to-use fonts can be obtained from the
author at the address below.

Short instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have got the fonts, and unpacked PSLaTeX (by executing the
shar file), you should convert the .pl files distributed with PSLaTeX
to .tfm files (using pltotf, part of the standard TeX distribution),
and place them into your standard TFM directory (usually
/usr/lib/tex/fonts).  Then build PSLaTeX.  Instructions can be found
in pslatex.tex; a short form (for UNIX sites) is given below.  LaTeX
and print pslatex.tex, then, after installing PSLaTeX, process
pslatex.tex with PSLaTeX.

To print DVI files produced by PSLaTeX you must have a DVI to
PostScript processor capable of using unmapped device-resident fonts.
Additionally, you must modify the header file downloaded to your
PostScript device as per the instructions below.  (If you don't have a
DVI->PostScript program, you can get one (for BSD UNIX) from the
address below.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Installing PSLaTeX under UNIX (assuming you are running the
		standard (UofW) distribution)

1. If you have not already done so, unpack PSLaTeX by running /bin/sh
   on the shar file.  Convert each .pl file, into a .tfm file by typing
	make tfms
   Put the .tfm files in your standard tfm directory (usually
   /usr/lib/tex/fonts; if so
   	make install-tfms
   will do the job.)

2. Get hold of the TFMs for the fonts resident in your PostScript
   device.  For the default setup, you will need at least the following:
   	Times-Roman, Times-Italic, Times-Bold, Times-Oblique,
   	Symbol and Symbol-Oblique.
   Check the design size of these fonts (convert one TFM file to PL
   format using tftopl, and look for the line containing the word
   DESIGNSIZE).  They should be at size 10pt, ie the line should read
	(DESIGNSIZE R 10.0)
   If they are at 1.0pt, you need to convert them to 10pt.  A shell
   script (cnvfonts) is provided that will do this for you.

3. Modify fntchoice.tex for the names of the TFM files to use for \rm,
   etc.  (If you accept the setup as distributed, you don't need to
   make any modifications.)  You may have to do this for one of two
   reasons: 
    a) if you have a version of dvi2ps that relies on specific types
       of names for PostScript fonts, e.g., that they begin with "PS".
       If this is so, you will also have to rename the TFM files
       accordingly. 
    b) The TFM files you use have names of the long form (eg
       Times-Roman), and you don't want to change them.  As
       distributed, PSLaTeX assumes you will use short names (eg
       t-rom), as these are more portable amongst different operating
       systems.   The correspondence between short and long names can
       be found in the file font-table.
   If you don't modify fntchoice.tex but have TFM files with long
   names (eg Times-Roman.tfm), then you'll have to make equivalent TFM
   files with short names, by copying or linking.  The shell script
   long2sh will create links based on the names in font-table.

4. Build the pslplain.fmt file:
	$ initex
	This is TeX, Version 2.0 for Berkeley UNIX (INITEX)
	**pslplain \dump
	(pslplain.tex
	...
	\font\tencirc=circle10
	\font\tencircw=circlew10
	36832 words of font info for 108 preloaded fonts
	14 hyphenation exceptions
	Hyphenation trie of length 5942 has 181 ops
	No pages of output.
   This will use the files lplain.tex, hyphen.tex and latex.tex that
   came with your standard LaTeX, but will substitute a new version of
   lfonts.tex.

5. Copy pslplain.fmt to your "standard" area for format files
   (/usr/lib/tex/macros, more often than not).

6. If you want, you can build a "preloaded" PSLaTeX (see instructions
   that accompanied your TeX distribution).

	Hints on DVI->PostScript convertors

There are many, many DVI to PostScript convertors available now, each
with a different set of features.  To guide you in choosing one to use
with PSLaTeX, you should bear the following in mind:
 - LaTeX uses the Computer Modern (CM) fonts, for which PK, GF, or PXL
   files are provided as part of the TeX distribution.  The files
   contain the bitmaps used to print each glyph in a font.  PSLaTeX
   uses fonts resident within the PostScript printing engine, and does
   not need bitmaps for these fonts, only width information in the
   form of a TeX Metric File (TFM).  Indeed, bitmaps for these fonts
   are not generally available.
   Therefore, a convertor to be used with PSLaTeX must recognise that
   some fonts are resident within the printing engine, and not attempt
   to download bitmaps.
 - As mentioned in the document that describes font usage in PSLaTeX,
   some of the fonts used are derived (by simple geometric
   transformations, implemented in PostScript) from the existing
   fonts.  Oblique fonts are made by "sloping" an upright font,
   SmallCaps fonts contain the upper-case glyphs from an existing font
   reduced by 20%, etc.  It would be nice if such fonts had been
   designed from scratch and made available to the general public, but
   they haven't been, and we're stuck with the situation.  Hence some
   PostScript needs to be sent to the printer to "generate" these
   fonts.  Suitable PostScript can be found in makefonts.ps, and this
   can be tacked onto the end of any existing header file that your
   convertor uses.
