For all you who have thought that TeX should be able to generate Table
of Contents by itself, instead of making you type it in and format
it by hand, your wishes have been granted.  A new set of commands has
been added to TBase that allows a Table of Contents to be automatically
generated from the chapter and section names while the rest of the paper
is being processed.  These commands have been written so as to be
easilly added to any existing TeX file.


These new commands are:

\input TexToc          % loads table of contents macro.
\make_toc{<level>}     % Places Table of Contents at this place in Paper
                       %  <level> should  be a number between 0 and 5 denoting 
                       %   how many levels of nesting in T.O.X are to occur
                       %       0 -   none                    
                       %       1 -   chapters only
                       %       2 -   chapters and sections only
                       %  and so on ...

\def\toc_pages{<#>}    % Specifies the number of pages the Table of Contents
                       % is going to be.  Unfortunatly, this must be set by
                       % you, because I haven't figured out how to do it
                       % automatically.  Currently defaulted to 1.


In order to generate the Table of Contents, the general format of the
TeX file must be:

   \input TBase        % loads Tbase Package
   \input Paper        % loads several formating routines
   \input TexToc       % loads table of contents macros

   \< ... font ...>    % defines font

   <\title_page ,,,>
   <\abstract   ,,,>

   \make_toc{2}        % places T.O.C. right after abstract.  
   \def\toc_pages{1}   % Expect one page in Table of Contents 

   <... body of paper ...> 

   <\appendix{. Title .} ,,,>  % One or more optional appendices.
                               %   Do not use sections, subsection ect, here yet.
                               %   The numbering is not correct.
       
   <\references ,,,}

   \end_input          % This command must be called inorder to print out T.O.C.

More documentation for the routines table of contents routines is available
in the file OZ:<TEX.MACROS>textoc.texlib.

This package was written with the M.I.T. thesis specifications in mind.  
The big change is that
     The entire Thesis (including the title page, prefatory 
     material, illustrations, and all text) must be numbered continuously 
     from begining to end.  
               (Pg. 6, Specifications for hesis Preparation - 1982)
New macros for the title page, abstract, appendicies, and references have
been made so this occurs.

As one final note, the table of contents package sort of expects that
the whole paper is run through at the same time.  When working with long
papers, care must be taken to avoid having large groups so that memsize
is not exceeded.  If proper care is taken, however, long papers (100
pages or longer) can be run off without this problem occuring.  I
strongly suggest, however, that you break the paper up into short
sections until the last possible moment.

The routines in this package were written first by Peter Szolovits 
(PSZ@MIT-ML).  Minor problems, Thesis Format, and documentation was
supplied by John Bradstreet. (Bradst@MIT-OZ).

Please send all comments, suggestions, bugs, and flames about the
routines in this package to me (Bradst@MIT-OZ) or to (Bug-TeX).
I'll try to get back to you as soon a possible.
