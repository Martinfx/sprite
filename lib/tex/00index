Note: I use the shorthand notation [1-9] to mean any character from 1
to 9, and * to mean any string. The archive server does not understand
wildcards of these forms, please explicitly name all files.

The convention is that a .doc file contains both documentation and what
goes in the .sty file. So if the .sty file is inaccesible, try asking
for the .doc file.
