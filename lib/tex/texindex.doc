There is a program TEXINDEX (in VAX/VMS Pascal) which will sort the file of
index entries written by LaTeX when you request an index (with \makeindex).
This program was originally written in INTERLISP by Terry Winograd and Bill
Paxton.  It was converted into Pascal by Skip Montanaro.  The interface to
LaTeX was written by Charles Karney (Karney%PPC.MFENET@NMFECC.ARPA)

In order to use it, specify ``texindex'' as one of the optional
arguments to \documentstyle.  E.g.,
    \documentstyle[texindex,11pt]{article}.

Specify \makeindex (as documented in the LaTeX manual) to turn on the
collection of entries.

For each entry you wish to index specify
    \index{topic;subtopic;subsubtopic}
The semicolons separate the topics from the subtopics.  E.g.,
    We next consider the ballooning
    instability\index{instabilities;ballooning}.
The subtopics are optional.  In the above example, you could have used
\index{ballooning instabilities} to provide a separate index entry for
ballooning instabilities.

At the point at which you want the index to appear, type
    \insertindex

The procedure for producing an up-to-date index for paper.tex is as
follows:

(1) Run LaTeX on your file.  This produces an unsorted index file
paper.idx.
(2) Run TEXINDEX with
    TEXINDEX paper
This reads paper.idx and produces a sorted index file paper.ind.
(3) Rerun LaTeX on your original file.
