The LaTeX style collection now contains the files listed below.  You
should retrieve the file 00index first to obtain a brief description of
current directory contents.  The file 00directory contains a reverse
time sorted list of files; this may be helpful in keeping your
collection in sync with LaTeX-style.

More submissions are very welcome.

1. For Internet users - how to ftp:

Here is an example session.  Disclaimer: ftp syntax varies from host to
host. Your syntax may be different. The syntax presented here is that
of Unix ftp. Comments in parentheses.

% ftp cayuga.cs.rochester.edu	(a.k.a. cs.rochester.edu, a.k.a. 192.5.53.209)
 ...				(general blurb)
user: anonymous
password: <any non-null string>
ftp> cd public/latex-style	(where the files are)
ftp> ls				(to see what is there)
 ...				(lots of output)
ftp> get 00index
 ...				(more blurb)
ftp> quit

2. Non-Internet users - how to retrieve by mail:

An archive server has been installed. Send a piece of mail to LaTeX-Style
(@cs.rochester.edu, via uucp or your favourite gateway) in the following
format:

Subject line should contain the phrase "@file request".  Body of the
mail should start with a line containing only an @ (at) sign.
The first line following should be a mail address FROM rochester TO
you.  Then follow by the names of the files you want, either one to
each line, or many to each line, separated by spaces.  End with a line
containing only an @ sign.  Case is not significant.

For example, if you are user at site.bitnet, this is what you should send:

To: latex-style@cs.rochester.edu
Subject: @file request

@
user%site.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu		(don't forget your address!)
00readme
00index
@

A word to the wise: it is best to fully qualify your mail address. Our
mailer is pretty ignorant of Bitnet, CSnet or UUCP addresses unless they
are in registered domains.  It is best that you supply explicit gateway
routes.  Use the new domainized form or addresses whenever possible.

If the Subject: line looks like:

Subject: @file request uuencode

	or

Subject: @file request rscsencode

then the mail will be encoded with the requested scheme before
sending.  This _might_ help sites that get mail through gateways with
unfriendly EBCDIC/ASCII mappings. You can find sources for the two
types of en/decoders in the collection. You may have to do some porting
of sources.

Be patient as the server is actually a batch program run once a day.
Files will be sent in batches, each not exceeding 100kbytes in size.

3. Distribution for IBM PC and clone users:

There are two sources.

	David W. Hopper
	446 Main Street
	Toronto, Ontario
	Canada M4C 4Y2

has LaTeX style files only.

1. Either one 1.2 MB diskette or three 360KB diskettes, blank and formatted.
2. Indication of the format required,
3. A self-addressed mailer, and
4. A $5.00 donation per set of files, to cover postage and equipment
wear & tear. (If you live outside North America, airmail delivery will
probably require more postage. You should probably contact David for
details.)
5. No phone calls or personal visits please.

	Jon Radel
	P.O. Box 2276
	Reston, VA 22090

has LaTeX style files and other goodies.  For a list or other info send a SASE.

1. 360KB diskettes, blank and formatted.
2. A stamped, self-addressed mailer, and
3. $1.50 per disk. If you live outside North America, skip the stamps
and send additional money or International Reply Coupons.

As a convenience for people who have more money than floppies, Jon will
supply everything for $6.00 per disk to U.S./Canada/Mexico addresses.
