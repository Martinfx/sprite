# This Makefile is included by the user's Makefile.  It sets the
# target machine type (TM), though the user can override it in the
# "make" command.  This operation is done here so that we can add
# backward-compatible machine types (e.g., ds5000) and have users
# easily treat the new machine type the same as the old one.

@If there is only one legal target type, make that the default (rather
than always using the machine type that pmake is running on).  This
restores the semantics we had with the DEFTARGET stuff, and it allows
us to say "pmake sun3" on a sun4 even if sun4 isn't a legal target type.
