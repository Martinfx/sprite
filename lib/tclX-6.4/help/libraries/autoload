          autoload file proc1 [..procN]

          The autoload procedure, defined in TclInit.tcl, allows the
          Tcl programmer to name one or more procedures and the file
          they are defined in.  After autoload has been executed to
          inform Tcl of the presence of them, a subsequent attempt to
          execute one of the procedures will cause the corresponding
          file to be loaded transparently prior to executing the
          function.  If file is a name without directories, then the
          path is searched to locate the file.  For example,
          executing:

               autoload showproc.tcl showproc showprocs

          tells Tcl to automatically load the file showproc.tcl the
          first time in the current session that either showproc or
          showprocs is executed.
