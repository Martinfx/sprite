          time command ?count?
               This command will call the Tcl interpreter count  times
               to  execute command (or once if count isn't specified).
               It will then return a string of the form

                    503 microseconds per iteration

               which indicates the average amount of time required per
               iteration,   in  microseconds.   Time  is  measured  in
               elapsed time, not CPU time.
