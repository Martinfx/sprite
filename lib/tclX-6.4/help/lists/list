          list arg ?arg ...?
               This command returns a list comprised of all the  args.
               Braces  and backslashes get added as necessary, so that
               the index command may be used  on  the  result  to  re-
               extract  the  original arguments, and also so that eval
               may be used to execute the resulting  list,  with  arg1
               comprising  the  command's  name  and  the  other  args
               comprising  its  arguments.   List  produces   slightly
               different  results  than  concat:   concat  removes one
               level of grouping before forming the list,  while  list
               works   directly  from  the  original  arguments.   For
               example, the command

                    list a b {c d e} {f {g h}}

               will return

                    a b {c d e} {f {g h}}
               while concat with the same arguments will return

                    a b c d e f {g h}
