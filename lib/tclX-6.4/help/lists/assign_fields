          assign_fields list var [var...]
               Assign successive elements in a list to specified
               variables.  Any leftover fields are discarded.  When
               there are more variable names than fields, the
               remaining variables are set to the empty string.

               For example,

                  assign_fields {dave 100 200 "Dave Foo"} name uid gid longName

               Assigns name to ``dave'', uid to ``100'', gid to
               ``200'', and longName to ``Dave Foo''.
