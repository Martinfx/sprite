          linsert list index element ?element element ...?
               This command produces a new list from list by inserting
               all of the element arguments just  before  the  indexth
               element  of  list.  Each element argument will become a
               separate element of the new list.   If  index  is  less
               than  or  equal  to  zero,  then  the  new elements are
               inserted at the beginning of the  list.   If  index  is
               greater  than or equal to the number of elements in the
               list, then the new elements are appended to the list.
