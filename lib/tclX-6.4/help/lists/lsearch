          lsearch list pattern
               Search  the  elements  of  list  to  see if one of them
               matches pattern.  If so, the command returns the  index
               of  the  first  matching  element.  If not, the command
               returns -1.  Pattern matching is done in the  same  way
               as for the string match command.
