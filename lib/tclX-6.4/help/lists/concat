          concat arg ?arg ...?
               This  command  treats  each  argument  as  a  list  and
               concatenates  them  into a single list.  It permits any
               number of arguments.  For example, the command

                    concat a b {c d e} {f {g h}}

               will return

                    a b c d e f {g h}
               as its result.
