          format formatString ?arg arg ...?
               This command generates a formatted string in  the  same
               way  as the C sprintf procedure (it uses sprintf in its
               implementation).  FormatString indicates how to  format
               the  result,  using  %  fields  as  in sprintf, and the
               additional arguments, if  any,  provide  values  to  be
               substituted  into  the  result.   All  of  the  sprintf
               options  are  valid;  see  the  sprintf  man  page  for
               details.   Each  arg  must match the expected type from
               the  %  field  in  formatString;  the  format   command
               converts  each  argument to the correct type (floating,
               integer,  etc.)  before  passing  it  to  sprintf   for
               formatting.   The only unusual conversion is for %c; in
               this case the argument must be a decimal string,  which
               will  then  be  converted  to  the  corresponding ASCII
               character value.  Format does backslash substitution on
               its  formatString  argument,  so backslash sequences in
               formatString will be  handled  correctly  even  if  the
               argument is in braces.  The return value from format is
               the formatted string.
