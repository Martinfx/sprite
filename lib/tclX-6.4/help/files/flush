          flush fileId
               Flushes any output that has been buffered  for  fileId.
               FileId  must have been the return value from a previous
               call to open, or it may be stdout or stderr  to  access
               one  of  the  standard  I/O streams; it must refer to a
               file that was opened for writing.  This command returns
               an empty string.
