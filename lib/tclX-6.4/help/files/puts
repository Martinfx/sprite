          puts fileId string ?nonewline?
               Writes the characters given by string to the file given
               by  fileId.   Puts normally outputs a newline character
               after string, but this feature  may  be  suppressed  by
               specifying  the nonewline argument.  Output to files is
               buffered internally by Tcl; the flush  command  may  be
               used to force buffered characters to be output.  FileId
               must have been the return value from a previous call to
               open,  or it may be stdout or stderr to refer to one of
               the standard I/O channels; it must refer to a file that
               was opened for writing.
