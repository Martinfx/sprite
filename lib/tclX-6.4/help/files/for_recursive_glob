          for_recursive_glob var globlist code
               Performs a foreach-style loop for each file and
               directory that recursively matched one or more patterns
               specified in the call to for_recursive_glob, setting
               var to the matching file or directory, and calling
               code.  The break and continue statements work as
               expected.
