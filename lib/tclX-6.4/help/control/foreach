          foreach varname list body
               In this command, varname is the  name  of  a  variable,
               list is a list of values to assign to varname, and body
               is a collection of Tcl commands.   For  each  field  in
               list (in order from left to right), foreach assigns the
               contents of the field to  varname  (as  if  the  lindex
               command had been used to extract the field), then calls
               the Tcl interpreter to execute  body.   The  break  and
               continue  statements  may  be invoked inside body, with
               the same effect as in  the  for  command.   Foreach  an
               empty string.
