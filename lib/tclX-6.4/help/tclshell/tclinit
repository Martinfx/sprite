          The Tcl initialization file, normally TclInit.tcl in the
          main Tcl script directory, initializes the Tcl shell.  It
          defines various Tcl procedures that are required to
          implement loading of Tcl source from libraries via the
          package library and autoload facilities.

          If the Tcl is invoked interactively, it will source a file
          named .tclrc in the user's home directory, if it exists.
          Tcl is viewed primarly as a programming language, not an
          interactive shell, so the .tclrc is intended for use for
          loading development utilities, not to support applications,
          which should not have to rely on the user's environment in
          such a manner.
