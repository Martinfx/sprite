          wait pid
               Waits for the process identified by process id pid to
               terminate, either due to an untrapped signal or call to
               exit system call.  Wait returns a list containing three
               elements:  The first element is the process id of the
               process that terminated.  If the process exited
               normally, the second element is `EXIT', and the third
               contains the numeric exit code.  If the process
               terminated due to a signal, the second element is
               `SIG', and the third contains the signal name.  If the
               process is currently stopped (on systems that support
               SIGSTP), the second element is `STOP', followed by the
               signal name.
