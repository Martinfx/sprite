.SH NAME
name \- Short description of what program does
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBname\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIfile file ...\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-x\fR" 14
Sample option so you can see what it looks like.
.IP "\fB\-y \fIname\fR" 14
Another sample option with an argument \fIname\fR.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS biggestType biggestName
.AP int argc in
Number of arguments on command line.
.AP char **argv in/out
Command line arguments passed to main program.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
In this section you describe how to use the program.  The description
should be relatively complete, but terse.  For complex programs,
use multiple sections, each describing some aspect of the program.
Here are some notes about how to write manual pages:
.IP [1]
For commands, all the options should be described in the summary box above,
using an \fBOPTIONS\fR section and one \fB.IP\fR for each option.
.IP [2]
For procedures, all of the arguments to the procedure or procedures
should be described in the summary box above, using a \fBARGUMENTS\fR
section and one \fB.AP\fR for each argument.  You shouldn't normally
have both the \fBOPTIONS\fR and \fBARGUMENTS\fR sections in the
same man page.  The \fB.AS\fR macro is used to set tab stops for
the arguments, so they don't run into each other.
.IP [3]
Wherever a term in the manual entry refers to something you
would type verbatim, such as the name of a program or a switch,
use \fBboldface\fR for that term wherever it appears in the manual
entry.
.IP [4]
Wherever a term in the manual entry refers to a meta-symbol, in
place of which the user would type something else, such as \fIfile\fR
in the synopsis above, or the \fIname\fR argument in the \fB-y\fR
option, use \fIitalics\fR for the term wherever it appears in
the manual entry.
.SH KEYWORDS
form, manual
