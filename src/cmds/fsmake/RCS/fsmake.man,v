.SH NAME
fsmake \- Create a file system on a disk partition.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBfsmake -dev \fIdevice\fP -part \fIpartition\fP [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-dev\fI device\fR" 14
\fIDevice\fP is the root name of a device, i.e. rxy0, rsd1, rsb0
.IP "\fB\-part\fI partition\fR" 14
\fIPartition\fP is a letter indicating a partition, i.e. a, b, c, d, e, f, g.
.IP "\fB\-devDir\fI devDir\fR" 14
\fIDevDir\fR is an alternate directory in which to find the device file
named by concatenating \fIdevice\fR and \fIpartition\fR.  The default 
directory name is ``/dev``.
.IP "\fB\-initialPart\fI firstPartName\fR" 14
\fIfirstPartName\fP is the name of the initial partition on the disk
which contains basic disk geometry information.  The default is partition
``a''.
.IP "\fB\-write\fR" 14
Write the disk.  The default is to
not write the disk.
.IP "\fB\-overlap\fR" 14
Overlap filesystem blocks across track boundaries. The default is to not overlap
blocks.
.IP "\fB\-ratio\fR" 14
Ratio of Kbytes to file descriptors. The default is 4.
.IP "\fB\-test\fR" 14
Don't write to the disk. This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-scsi\fR" 14
Compute the disk geometry for a SCSI disk. The geometry will be laid out
to maximize usable storage.
.IP "\fB\-noscsi\fR" 14
Compute the disk geometry for a non-SCSI disk. The geometry will be laid out
to maximize transfer bandwidth.  The file system currently doesn't do 
anything intelligent when laying out a file, so this option is probably
not worth anything.
.IP "\fB\-host\fI hostID\fR" 14
Sets the host id field in the domain header. The default is to use the local
host id if the device server is the local host, otherwise use the device
server's id.
\fIHostID\fR is either the name or Sprite id of the machine to 
which the domain will be attached. 
.IP "\fB\-boot\fI bootSectors\fR" 14
Number of sectors in the root partition to reserve for the boot program.
.IP "\fB\-repartition\fR" 14
This option will change the partitioning of the disk.  
DO NOT USE IF THE DISK CONTAINS A FILESYSTEM YOU WISH TO KEEP. 
Use the
\fB\-partdisktab\fR option to use the partitioning information in
the disktab file, otherwise use the \fB\-size\fR option to set
the size of the current partition.
.IP "\fB\-partdisktab\fR" 14
Use in conjunction with the \fB\-repartition\fR option to set the
disk partitioning from the disktab file.
.IP "\fB\-size\fI percentage\fR" 14
Use in conjunction with the \fB\-repartition\fR option to specify
the size of the current partition as a percentage of the total disk
size. \fIPercentage\fR is an integer from 0-100.
.IP "\fB\-reconfig\fR" 14
Reconfigures the basic disk geometry.  
DO NOT USE IF THE DISK CONTAINS A FILESYSTEM YOU WISH TO KEEP. 
If the disk is a non-scsi disk then you must also specify
the \fB\-configdisktab\fR option which causes the disk geometry
to be read from the disktab file.  If the disk is a scsi disk
then you may omit the \fB\-configdisktab\fR option.
\fIFsmake\fR will then invent a configuration that minimizes wasted
disk space.
.IP "\fB\-configdisktab\fR" 14
Use in conjunction with the \fB\-reconfig\fR option to set the
disk configuration (geometry) from the disktab file.
.IP "\fB\-disktabName\fI filename\fR" 14
Specify the disktab file.  The default is \fI/etc/disktab\fR.
.IP "\fB\-disktype\fI type\fR" 14
Specify the type of disk.  This \fItype\fR parameter must
be the type of disk found in the disktab file.  This option
must be present in order to use the disktab file.
.IP "\fB\-labeltype\fI type\fR" 14
Type of label to write on the disk.  The default is to write whatever
label is appropriate for the machine on which \fBfsmake\fR is run.
.IP "\fB\-dir\fI directory\fR" 14
Copy the specified directory into the newly created filesystem.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBFsmake\fR will create a Sprite filesystem on a partition. 
It has a large number of options and is intended to be invoked from
a shell script.
\fBFsmake\fR's basic function is to create a filesystem out of an
entire partition by initializing the 
the file descriptor
bitmap, data block bitmap and domain header, and creating
the root and lost+found directories.
If you desire you can copy a directory tree into the new filesystem
via the \fB\-dir\fR option.
The \fB\-dir\fR option is intended to be used under UNIX.
If you need to copy stuff into the new filesystem under Sprite
use the \fBupdate\fR command.
The rest of the options are more complex and probably not used often.
The disk configuration, such as sectors per track, tracks per cylinder,
etc, can be set using the \fB\-reconfig\fR option.
Don't use this option if the disk contains anything you want to keep,
since it may goof up the size and location of the disk partition.
If you don't specify the \fB\-configdisktab\fR option then
\fBfsmake\fR will make up a configuration that minimizes wasted disk
space.  This only works under Sprite and on SCSI disks.
.pp
The \fB\-repartition\fR allows you to change the partitioning of the disk.
The \fB\-partdisktab\fR will set the partitioning from the disktab file.
Once again, don't use this option if there is valuable stuff on the disk
since you may lose it.
If you don't use the \fB\-partdisktab\fR option then you have to use the
\fB\-size\fR option to set the size of the current partition as a
percentage of the total disk size. 
\fBFsmake\fR will adjust the start of all paritions that "follow"
the current one on the disk.
Note that \fBfsmake\fR assumes an ordering on the partitions, ie
'a' starts at the beginning of the disk, 'g' follows 'a', 'f' follows
'e' which in turn follows 'd' which in turn follows 'a'. 'c' is the whole
disk and 'b' is not used. 
If you want to change the size of a bunch of partitions then run \fBfsmake\fR
on the patritions in alphabetical order.  That should do the right thing.
.pp
The \fB-ratio\fP option allows you
change the ratio of file system blocks to file descriptors.
Non-SCSI disks can have their file system blocks overlap track
boundaries by specifying the \fB-overlap\fP option.  This packs
more blocks per cylinder.
.SH Fsmake on UNIX
.pp
The \fBfsmake\fR command can be run on a UNIX system to create a 
Sprite filesystem.
There are several differences in functionality. 
First, \fBfsmake\fR cannot make up a configuration for the disk.
The configuration must be set from the disktab file.
Second, the \fB\-dir\fR option uses a special mechanism for creating
Sprite devices.  If \fBfsmake\fR comes across a file with the suffix
"SPRITE_DEV" it is assumed to be a placeholder for a Sprite device.
The contents of the file specify the device server, major number and
minor number.  Lines that are blank or begin with '#' are ignored.
The file should contain one line with three integers -- the device
server SpriteID, major number (device type), and minor number (device unit).

\fBFsmake\fR will create a filesystem on a partition. 
The root and lost+found directories are created and the file descriptor
bitmap, data block bitmap and domain header are initialized.
The file system completely uses up the specified partition,
so there is no size to specify.  When running in
test mode the number of file descriptors and data blocks that would
be made is printed out.  The \fB-ratio\fP option allows you

\fBFsmake\fR will create a file named ".fscheck.out" in all 'a' and 'c'
partitions. This file is used by \fBfscheck\fR to store the output of
checking the root partition on a file server.
