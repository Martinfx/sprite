.SH NAME
dailydump \- Script to do daily dumps
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdailydump\fR [\fB\-i\fR] [\fIstartFs\fR]
.IP "\fIstartFs\fR" 15
Start dumping with the named filesystem.
.IP "\-i" 15
Initialize the tape drive, remove the weekly dump lock file, and exit.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script does a level-1 dump of all filesystems that are normally
backed up.  (A level-1 dump captures all changes since the previous
level-0 dump for the given filesystem.)  It is normally invoked in the
wee hours of the morning by
.BR cron .
.PP
When the script has completed, it sends mail to the current dumper
(see the man page for
.BR weeklydump ), 
giving the amount of free space left on the current tape.
If there are detectable errors, mail is sent to the dumper with an error
message.
.PP
There are normally two reasons for manually invoking
.BR dailydump .
The first is to re-enable the daily dumps after the weekly dumps have
completed.  This is what the
.B \-i
option is for.  It ensures that the lock file used by the weekly dumps
is gone, and it initializes the tape currently in the drive.  (The dumps won't
actually commence until invoked by
.BR cron ).
.PP
The other reason for invoking 
.B dailydump
by hand is to restart the dumps if the machine running them crashed
before the dumps could finish.  In this case the user should specify the
filesystem that was being dumped when the machine crashed.  The dumps
will begin immediately.
.PP
When invoking 
.BR dailydump , 
be sure you're running as root.

.SH FILES
All of the following files are in /sprite/admin/dump:
.IP doingdaily.active 15
status file used to detect crashes.  Contains the name of the host
running the dumps.
.IP doingweekly 15
lock file to prevent daily dump from running
.IP dumpdates 15
list of filesystems dumped, at what time, what tape, etc.
.IP dumplist 15
list of filesystems to dump
.IP dumplog 15
very large status log from the dump programs
.IP tapelist 15
list of tape devices to use.  Dailydump uses the first drive on the list.

This script does no error checking.  After it has run, you should
check
.B /sprite/admin/dump/dumplog
and perhaps
.B /sprite/admin/dump/dumpdates
to make sure everything worked correctly.

The script appends each night's dumps to the end of the currently
loaded dump tape.  Run
.B dumpsize
to see if there is enough room on the tape for another set of dumps.
