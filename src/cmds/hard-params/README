hp.awk is a quick-and-dirty awk script to help you debug hard-params.
(hard-params runs itself through cpp a few times, which makes it hard
to specify breakpoints.)

If you need to debug hard-params, run the source file through cpp (by
hand, sigh), then filter that output with awk.  Compile the resulting
file and use it when dealing with the debugger.
