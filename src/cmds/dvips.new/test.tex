%   This file is a quick and simple, gross test of dvips.  It only tests
%   the most basic things.
%
%   To run:
%      remove the file mtest.ps if it exists
%      tex test
%      dvips test -o test.ps (ignore the error)
%      copy test.ps mtest.ps
%      dvips test
%   and print.
%
%   First, big rules.

%   Now, PostScript fonts.

%   Next, some alignment problems that are not done correctly by some
%   dvi2ps programs.

%
%   Now, included epsf graphics.  We include this document
%   recursively.  Of course, things will be ugly.
%
\input epsf
\epsfxsize=0.5\ohsize
%
%   If you go to a4 paper, change the following supplied bounding box
%   appropriately.
%
\line{\hfil\epsffile[18 18 594 774]{mtest.ps}\hfil
\vbox to 0.5\ovsize{\hsize=3.3truein\parindent=10pt\parskip=0pt plus 1fil
To run this test, remove a file called mtest.ps if it exists.
Then, run \TeX\ over
test.tex, run dvips over test.dvi, saving the output in a file test.ps.
Copy test.ps to mtest.ps.
Run dvips over test.dvi again, this time printing or saving the output,
as you choose.  (Including the document too many times inside itself
will overflow the virtual memory capacities of most printers.)

Some things to check on this page.  First, the large rules surrounding
the page should be exactly one quarter inch from each border (assuming
a 8.5 by 11 page; eventually I'll have a version for a4 as well.)
You should see a title at the top, and a large italic g under that.
Then, there should be a centered row of ten boxes, going from dark to
light gray, rotating slowly.

In the `equation' that follows, check the upper left corner of the radical
signs for alignment.  Also check the right arrows.

In the recursively included page to the left,
note how bad the bitmapped fonts look
(they are the ones under the the radical, and indeed this text itself.)
The thin
rules may disappear altogether.  This points out the resolution dependence
of dvips output; this is an unfortunate necessity of using bitmapped fonts.
The PostScript fonts, on the other hand, should scale fine.

Finally, at the bottom of the page, you will see some tests of the accents in
the PostScript fonts.  Pay careful attention to the word na\"\i ve; there
should be an umlaut over a dotless i.  The text should read
``Ich wei\ss\ tats\"achlich nicht mehr als das.
D\ae monic souffl\'es have no r\^ole in na\"\i ve \oe uvres.
\AE sop's \OE uvres.''
}\hfil}

%   Finally, PostScript fonts again; let's test some accents.
