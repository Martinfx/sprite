All information is now in the dvips manual.  This file is supplied as
dvips.tex; a PostScript version should be available where you got the
main dvips distribution.  Installation instructions are in that file.
Failing that, you can follow the brief instructions below.

To install this version of dvips:

	Update Makefile, in particular, the paths.
	Check file name definitions in MakeTeXPK.
		(If you don't have MF installed, don't
		install MakeTeXPK either.)
	Check the configuration parameters in config.ps.
		(Send the mem.ps file below to figure
		the memory in your PostScript printer for
		the `m' line in config.ps.)
	Run "make".
	Run "make install" if all went well.
