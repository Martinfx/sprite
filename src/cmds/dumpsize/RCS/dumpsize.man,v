.SH NAME
dumpsize \- Calculate size of dumps on a tape
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdumpsize\fR \fItapeNum\fR \fIdatesFile\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fItapeNum\fR" 15
The number of the tape in question.
.IP "\fIdatesFile\fR" 15
The path of the 
.B dumpdates
file.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script grovels over the
.B dumpdates
file and calculates how much space on the tape is taken by the dumps,
file marks, etc.  The tape number is the first argument.  (Each dump
tape has a number, which is written on the tape and its case.)  The
second argument is the path of the
.B dumpdates
file, usually
.BR /sprite/admin/dump/dumpdates .
.PP
The output from the script gives how much space is taken for each
day's dumps (including a guess at how much is needed for file marks)
and the total space taken on the tape.  This lets you guess how much
space will be needed for another day's dumps and whether it will fit
on the given tape.  (Allow 2 gigabytes for an Exabyte cassette.)

.SH KEYWORDS
dump, tape, backup, restore
