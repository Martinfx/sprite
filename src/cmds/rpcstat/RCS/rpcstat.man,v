.SH INTRODUCTION
This command is used to get statistics and trace information about the
Sprite kernel-to-kernel RPC system.
.SH "RPC TRACE"
.PP
The RPC trace has a record for the
last 100 packets sent or received in the RPC network protocol.  The trace
has the following fields:
.DS
\fBID code time flag commnd client server psize dsize doff fragment\fR
.DE
.IP \fBID\fR 10
The RPC sequence number.  A new ID is generated for each RPC, and
all packets involved with an RPC contain this ID.
.IP \fBcode\fR 10
Either "in" or "out" to mean the packet was transmitted or received.
.IP \fBtime\fR 10
Seconds since last packet.  Sun3 clock granularity is too low (10 msec) for this
to be meaningful.
.IP \fBflag\fR 10
.DS
\fBQ\fP reQuest packet.
\fBQp\fP reQuest with please acknowledge bit set.
\fBA\fP Acknowledgment packet.
\fBR\fP Reply packet.
\fBRe\fP Error reply; command field contains error code.
\fBAc\fP Close acknowledgment sent to close client/server binding.
.DE
.IP \fBcommand\fR 10
The RPC name.  If this is a number and the flag field is "Re",
then this is the returned error code.
.IP \fBclient\fR 10
Two numbers identify the client host and the client channel number.
.IP \fBserver\fR 10
Two numbers identify the server host and the server process number.
.IP \fBpsize\fR 10
The size of the parameter area of the packet.
.IP \fBdsize\fR 10
The size of the data area of the packet
.IP \fBdoff\fR 10
The offset of the data area.  Used when fragmenting large data blocks.
.IP \fBfragment\fR 10
Two numbers are the number of fragments and the fragment bitmask.
.SH "CLIENT RPC"
.PP
The client half of the RPC system maintains statistics about the
number of timeouts, retransmissions, etc.  The output of the \fB\-cinfo\fP
option is (nearly) self-explanatory.  There are also a set of
\fIchannels\fP used by the client side of RPC.  Each channel is
dynamically bound to a particular server host/process pair, and
the kernel attempts to reuse the channel for successive RPCs to that server.
The \fB\-chan\fP option prints out the state of the client channels,
what they are bound to, what RPC is in progress, etc.
The binding is not hard, but is used to optimize away explicit
acknowledgment packets.
.SH "SERVER RPC"
.PP
The server half of the RPC system maintains statistics about the
number of requests it has received, the number of requests that
implicitly acknowledged a previous reply, etc.  The output of
the \fB\-sinfo\fP option is (nearly) self-explanatory.  There are also
a pool of kernel RPC server processes.  The \fB\-srvr\fP option
prints out the state of each, their current client, the current RPC, etc.
.SH HISTOGRAMS
.PP
The kernel can keep track of how long RPCs take.  For each RPC number
the kernel keeps the total time spent processing that RPC command, as
well as a histogram showing the distribution of times.  The
.B \-chist
option displays the client-side timings, whereas
.B \-shist
displays the server-side timings.  These options display the following
information for each RPC command: the command name, the number of
calls, the average time per call, the overhead for collecting the
timing information, and the timing distribution for the command.  The
timing distribution is a series of double lines.  The top line gives
the minimum times for a series of buckets, in microseconds, and the
bottom line gives the number of RPCs that fell into that bucket.
.PP
Use
.B rpccmd
to enable, disable, or reset these timings.
.SH BUGS
On current Sprite systems, the histogram resolution is finer than the
clock resolution, so many buckets will always have a count of 0.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH KEYWORDS

@Document histogram support.  Fix synposis line.  Fix documentation for
some options that were apparently renamed some time ago.
