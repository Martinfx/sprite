.SH NAME
kgdb \- A kernel debugger based on GDB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBkgdb\fR [\fI-mtm\fR]\ [\fIgdb options\fR] [\fIkernel\fR]
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-mtm\fR" 14
Invoke the debugger for the target machine given by tm.  If specified, this
option must proceed all other options. The list of available target machines
include sun2, sun3, sun4, and spur.
.LP
See the GNU GDB documentation for information about the rest of the available
options.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBKgdb\fR is a version of the GNU gdb debugger modified to debug Sprite
kernels.
This manual page only describes the parts of \fBkgdb\fR that differ 
from \fBgdb\fR.  
The reader is referred to the GNU GDB documentation and gdb manual page for a
complete description of \fBgdb\fR.
.SH "DIFFERENCES FROM GDB"
.LP
The "attach" and "detach" commands of \fBkgdb\fR differ from those of 
\fBgdb\fR.  
.IP "\fBattach\fR machine"
The attach command of \fBkgdb\fR takes as an argument the hostname or 
internet address of a Sprite machine to debug.  
The command assumes that the specified machine is in the kernel 
debugging stub and will wait for the machine to
enter the debugger.  Once the connection to the machine is 
established,
the trap condition and any unprinted syslog messages are displayed.
.IP "\fBdetach\fR [cont]"
The detach command breaks the connection between \fBkgdb\fR and the
currently attached machine.  If any argument is specified, the machine
is continued before the connection is detached.  When used with the 
"attach" command, the "detach" command allows debugging multiple machines 
from the same \fBkgdb\fR session.
.SH "ADDITIONS TO GDB"
\fBKgdb\fR supports several commands not found in \fBgdb\fR.  The commands
are:
.IP "\fBpid\fR proc-id"
The pid command sets the focus of the debugger on the  process whose
process id is proc-id. 
Once a process is choosen with the pid command,
all stack reference commands such as "backtrace" and "frame" will reference
this process's stack.  For example, the command "pid 0xa1139" followed
by the "backtrace" command will display a stack backtrace of the process
with pid of 0xa1139. Note that proc-id can be any expression supported by
\fBkgdb\fR.
.IP "\fBreboot\fR [string]"
The reboot command reboots the current attached machine. The optional
argument string is passed to the kernel routine Mach_MonReboot.  Note 
that this command is the same as typing "print Mach_MonReboot(string)" followed
by a break and a detach command except that the reboot command will work 
even if no symbol table is loaded.
.IP "\fBversion\fR"
The version command prints the kernel version string of the 
attached machine. This command outputs the same information as the
command "print SpriteVersion()" but like the "reboot" command doesn't
require a symbol table to be loaded.
.IP "\fBdebug\fR hostname"
The debug command is similar to the attach command differing only
in the case when the specified machine is not already in the debugging stub.  
Rather than waiting
for the machine to enter the debugger like the attach command, the
debug command will force the machine into the debugger using 
the \fBkmsg\fR program. 
In order for this command to work, 
the \fBkmsg\fR program must be available in the current
search path of \fBkgdb\fR. Because of its anti-social possiblities, 
caution is urged in the use of the debug command.
.SH "DELETIONS FROM GDB"
.LP
Several features of \fBgdb\fR are not available in \fBkgdb\fR because 
they don't apply to kernel debugging.
Missing features include the ability to start and kill programs with the 
"run"
and "kill" commands; to change the program's environment and
terminal characteristics with the
"set-env", "unset-env", "set-args", and "tty" commands;  
and  to handle signals with
"handle" and "signal" commands.  
Additionaly, \fBgdb\fR's core file processing such as the 
.B core
command are also 
not available in \fBkgdb\fR.
