	* Changes from CVS 1.0 Patchlevel 1 to CVS 1.0 Patchlevel 2; also
	known as "Changes from CVS 1.1 to CVS 1.2".

	* Major new support with this release is the ability to use the
	recently-posted RCS 5.5 distribution with CVS 1.2.  See below for
	other assorted bug-fixes that have been thrown in.

	* ChangeLog (new): Added Emacs-style change-log file to CVS 1.2
	release.  Chronological description of changes between release.

	* README: Small fixes to installation instructions.  My email
	address is now "berliner@sun.com".

	* src/Makefile: Removed "rcstime.h".  Removed "depend" rule.

	* src/partime.c:  Updated to RCS 5.5 version with hooks for CVS.
	* src/maketime.c: Updated to RCS 5.5 version with hooks for CVS.
	* src/rcstime.h:  Removed from the CVS 1.2 distribution.
	Thanks to Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> for these changes.

	* src/checkin.csh: Support for RCS 5.5 parsing.
	Thanks to Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> for this change.

	* src/collect_sets.c (Collect_Sets): Be quieter if "-f" option is
	specified.  When checking out files on-top-of other files that CVS
	doesn't know about, run a diff in the hopes that they are really
	the same file before aborting.

	* src/commit.c (branch_number): Fix for RCS 5.5 parsing.
	Thanks to Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> for this change.

	* src/commit.c (do_editor): Bug fix - fprintf missing argument
	which sometimes caused core dumps.

	* src/modules.c (process_module): Properly NULL-terminate
	update_dir[] in all cases.

	* src/no_difference.c (No_Difference): The wrong RCS revision was
	being registered in certain (strange) cases.

	* src/patch.c (get_rcsdate): New algorithm.  No need to call
	maketime() any longer.
	Thanks to Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> for this change.

	* src/patchlevel.h: Increased patch level to "2".

	* src/subr.c (isdir, islink): Changed to compare stat mode bits
	correctly.

	* src/tag.c (tag_file): Added support for following symbolic links
	that are in the master source repository when tagging.  Made tag
	somewhat quieter in certain cases.

	* src/update.c (update_process_lists): Unlink the user's file if it
	was put on the Wlist, meaning that the user's file is not modified
	and its RCS file has been removed by someone else.

	* src/update.c (update): Support for "cvs update dir" to correctly
	just update the argument directory "dir".

	* src/cvs.h: Fixes for RCS 5.5 parsing.
	* src/version_number.c (Version_Number): Fixes for parsing RCS 5.5
	and older RCS-format files.
	Thanks to Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> for these changes.

	* src/version_number.c (Version_Number): Bug fixes for "-f" option.
	Bug fixes for parsing with certain branch numbers.  RCS
	revision/symbol parsing is much more solid now.

	timelocal() with call to maketime().
