	The files in this directory implement a simple ditroff postprocessor
for producing alphabetically-sorted indices. Macros in tmac.index are used
with the -ms macros to make entries in the index. Other helpful things are
planned but unimplemented as yet. See the macro file for more information.

Typical use will be:
	ditroff -Pcad -ms -t tmac.index doc.ms | index 

index will pick out the name of the typesetter to use, but it may be specified
explicitly with a -P argument. Normally, all output will be sent to lpr for
printing, but -t may be given to send the output to the standard output stream.
