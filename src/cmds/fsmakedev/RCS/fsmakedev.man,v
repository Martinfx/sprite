.SH NAME
fsmakedev \- Create a device file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfsmakedev\fR [\fB-s\fI serverID\fR] [\fB-d\fI devType\fR] [\fB-u\fI unit\fR] [\fB-p\fI mode\fR]
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-s \fIserverID\fR" 14
The serverID is needed for devices attached to a particular host.  If not
specified then the device created is a \fIcommon\fP device found on all hosts
and the local instance of the device is used.  The serverID is a numeric
hostID, not a name.
.IP "\fB\-d\fI devType\fR" 14
This specifies the type of the device.  This is a numeric value found in
/sprite/src/kernel/dev/*.md/devTypesInt.h
.IP "\fB\-u\fI unit\fR" 14
The unit number of the device.
.IP "\fB\-p\fI mode\fR" 14
This specifies the permission bits of the device file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Fsmakedev creates a special device file that is a placeholder for
a peripheral device.  The device file indicates the device type
and a unit number.  It also indicates the location of the device.
In Sprite devices are either \fIcommon\fP,
which means that all hosts have them, or they are specific to a
particular host.  When a common device is opened then the device
attached to the local host is used.  Otherwise the serverID in the
device file indicates where the device is.  The default is for
a common device file to be created.  Use the \fB-s\fP option to
specific the serverID for devices attached to a particular host.
By convention common devices are found in the /dev directory,
and specific devices are in the /hosts/\fIhostname\fP/dev directory.
.SH BUGS
.PP
The device type is a magic number found in the
/sprite/src/kernel/dev/*.md/devTypesInt.h file.
The serverID is a numeric hostID, not a hostname.
