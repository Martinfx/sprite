BUG:
I must be able to get autofocus in display window, or {shift middle} won't
work since the shift is seen as a keypress and goes to the header window!

1) After typing nothing and hitting return in a header window, it says "already
a group" but then doesn't redisplay the background big enough!  If you do an
mx-starting button press on something, it resets the handlers and then displays
it correctly again.

2) If you put focus into a header window, and then type on display window, focus
is still in header window and you can't get rid of it!

To fix, I put focus window as parent window:
>    The difference is that wsPtr->curFocusPtr is set for title when called with
>    surrounding window, but this isn't true for header.
>    --> If I put focus in header window and then type in the edit window, I get
>    the letters in the header window!

If I execute sun4.md/wish, it can't find .wish file!
Need interpreter in main for calls to WishCreate for its calls to
	Tx_SetupAndFork.
I can't seem to edit headers anymore!!!

Plus Mendel's bug discoveries.

BUG:  panic doesn't kill wish process, and it can't be killed.

What must I do to get border between tx window and upper scroll bar?  I'm
leaving in tx stripe right now to sort of hide this, but it's ugly this way.

Why must I copy interpreter result to buffer to display it?  (WishPrintTclError)


BUG:  If full string doesn't fit, it just displays blank!

BUG:  Initial size picking picks ugly size.  Is it really happenning?

BUG:  With option -nopick the display comes up blank!

BUG:  Auto resize fights with you if you resize the window.

BUG:  Auto resize picks very long window with mostly half blank
	when you add two fields.

    
Make scrollbar white if background is.

Move global display to be per-window.
Use X11 Size hints to deal with resize aspect ratios, etc.
John uses PResizeInc|PMinSize.
How can XCreateSimpleWindow, etc return error status?
PointerMotionMask && PointerMotionHintsMask?
Change to use selection instead of background in reverseGc, and call it
    selectionGc.
accessTime = atime = time file data last read or mod'd
descModifyTime = ctime = time file status last changed, writing
    and inode changes.  (true in sprite that writing changes this too?)
dataModifyTime = mtime = time data last modified.
createTime = ??????
FsflatRedraw in fsflatDisplay.c seems to imply that things can be
	sorted by more than one way at a time.  Is this true?  Bad.


Where I use ascent and descent for char heights, should I be calling
    an Sx DefaultHeight routine?

FIXED!!
BUG!: I bring it up in proc.  I then ask for access time.  I scroll to where
    DIFFS is first file.  Then it pops up notifier saying "Couldn't get
    attributes for file   .  The file may no longer exist.  It leaves
    it blank and includes date "0".  The position of file is between Makefile
    and Syscall, so it must be the RCS DIRECTORY...  

    Notifiers mess up and trash gets copied into names of directory files.

Bug:  selecting is highlighting fields as well as name.

BUG: exec ls $sel sticks word "exec" into tx window!
