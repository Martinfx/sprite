This is not a "distribution", it is only a snapshot of the
directory one day.  Someone needed it badly, so here it is.
There are a bunch of things left to do, and undoc'ed changes
and commands, and half-implemented things that may break.
All the ifdef's for other OS's than 4.2 have not been tested at all.
That said, I have been using this under 4.2 for months w/o problems.
