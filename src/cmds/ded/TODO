crh did:
	goto specific line number?
	abort all the way back?
	toggle full/split screen modes?

^C to interrupt sort query..
fix single non-dir arg
put some % indication in mode line
need cmd to move current file to top of screen
should not clear screen at exit
print command needs to be interruptible
avoid most commands on sockets
make inititialization dynamic so can just fork a recursive dired w/o an exec.
make downline() use \n
need to put out more terminal initization and termination strings
't/T' command has nothing to do with waiting anymore.  clean up code,
	maybe doc?
rmrf needs to shift status code over to make return code
	rm/rmrf distinction is hazy
	check on what systems -r option to rm exists
	needs cleanup-- the 02 accesses check is garbage
