takes a list of account names and removes them from the system.  
The user's account is removed from the password file and the user's
home directory is flushed.  In addition, an editor is invoked on the
system aliases file, so that the user can be removed from any mailing
lists she might belong to.
.PP

can also remove partially created or partially deleted accounts,
though it squawks a bit.
