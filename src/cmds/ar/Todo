The "struct member_name" should be better encapsulated.  For example,
there should probably be an init_name_from_stored function, rather
than having scan() set the fields directly.

Or, get rid of the "struct member_name" stuff and go back to using
plain strings.  The one problem is you don't want multiple error
(truncation) messages for the same name.
