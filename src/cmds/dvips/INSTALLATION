To install this version of dvips:

	Update makefile, in particular, the paths.
	Check file name definitions in MakeTeXPK.
	Check the configuration parameters in config.ps.
	Run "make".
	Run "make install" if all went well.

If the font caching is a security hole, then make the `cache'
directory be something like /tmp/pks, and cron a job to move the
good PK files into the real directory.  Or simply disable this
feature by not installing MakeTeXPK.
