.SH DESCRIPTION
PostScript fonts are (or should be) accompanied by font metric files
such as
.B Times-Roman.afm,
which describes the characteristics of the font called Times-Roman.
To use such fonts with TeX, we need TFM files that contain similar
information. The command
.sp
.ce
afm2tfm Times-Roman.afm Times-Roman.tfm
.sp
(which can be reduced to simply
.sp
.ce
afm2tfm Times-Roman
.sp
by taking default shortcuts) will create the necessary file
.B Times-Roman.tfm,
which can then be moved to the directory where TeX normally looks for
font metric information. The PostScript conversion program
.B dvips
will also treat Times-Roman as a resident PostScript font if you
include the line
.sp
.ce
Times-Roman
.sp
in the file
.I psfonts.map.

PostScript fonts have a different encoding scheme from that of plain
TeX. Although both schemes are based on ASCII, special characters such as
ligatures and accents are handled quite differently. Therefore we obtain
best results by using a "virtual font" interface, which makes TeX act
as if the PostScript font had a standard TeX encoding. Such a virtual
font can be obtained, for example, by the command
.sp
.ce
afm2tfm Times-Roman -v times
.sp
or, more fully, by:
.sp
.ce
afm2tfm Times-Roman.afm -v times.vpl Times-Roman.tfm
.sp
This produces two outputs, namely the "virtual property list" file
.B times.vpl
and the TeX font metric file
.B Times-Roman.tfm.
The latter file describes an "actual font" on which the virtual font is based.

To use the font in TeX, you should first run
.sp
.ce
vptovf times.vpl times.vf times.tfm
.sp
then install the file
.B times.vf
in the directory for virtual fonts and install
.B times.tfm
in the directory for TeX font metrics. (You can also make more complex
virtual fonts by editing
.B times.vpl
first.) Once this has been done, you're all set. You can use
code like this in TeX henceforth:
.sp
.nf
.na
        \efont\emyfont=times at 10pt
        \emyfont
        Hello, I am being typeset in Times-Roman.
.fi
.ad
.sp

Note that there are two fonts, one actual (`Times-Roman',
which is analogous to a raw piece of hardware) and
one virtual (`times', which
has typesetting knowhow added). You could also say
`\efont\eTR=Times-Roman at 10pt' and typeset directly with that, but then you
would have no ligatures or kerning, and you would have to use Adobe
character positions for special letters like \eae. The virtual font
called
.B
times
not only has ligatures and kerning, and most of the standard
accent conventions of TeX, it also has a few additional features
not present in the Computer Modern fonts. For example, it includes all
the Adobe characters (such as the Polish ogonek and the French
guillemots). It also allows you to type 58 accented letters
from `Aacute' to `zcaron' as if they were ligatures --- namely
as `acute' followed by `A', etc., where you can get `acute'
(\echar 19) by defining a suitable control sequence. (The 58
constructed characters are found in the AFM file, and constructed
as specified by Adobe; you may wish to adjust the spacing and/or
add additional accent combinations by editing the VPL file.)
The only things you lose from ordinary TeX text fonts are
the dotless j (which can be hacked into the VPL file with
literal PostScript specials if you have the patience) and
uppercase Greek letters (which just don't exist unless you buy
them separately).
.sp
These fonts can be scaled to any size.
Go wild!
Note, however, that using PostScript fonts does
use up the printer's virtual memory and it does take time.
You may find
downloading the Computer Modern fonts to be faster than using
the built-in PostScript fonts!

.SH OPTIONS
Special effects are also obtainable, with commands such as
.sp
.ce
afm2tfm Times-Roman -s .167 -v timessl Times-Slanted
.sp
which create
.B timessl.vpl
and
.B Times-Slanted.tfm.
To use this, proceed as above but put the line
.sp
Times-Slanted "/Times-Roman .167 SlantFont"
.sp
into
.I psfonts.map.
Then
.B Times-Slanted
will act as if it were a resident font, although it is actually
constructed from Times-Roman by PostScript hackery. 
(It's an oblique version of Times-Roman, obtained by slanting
everything 1/6 to the right.)
Similarly, you can get an extended font by
.sp
.ce
afm2tfm Times-Extended -e 1.2 -v timesx Times-Extended
.sp
and by recording the pseudo-resident font
.sp
Times-Extended "/Times-Roman 1.2 ExtendFont"
.sp
The command line switches are:
.IP "\fB-e\fP \fIratio\fP"
All characters are stretched horizontally by the stated
.I ratio;
if it is less than 1.0, you get a condensed font.
.IP "\fB-s\fP \fIslant\fP"
All characters are slanted to the right by the stated
.I slant;
if it is negative, the letters slope to the left (or they might be
upright if you start with an italic font).
.IP "\fB-v\fP \fIfile\fP[.\fIvpl\fP]"
Generate a virtual property list (VPL) file as well as a TFM file.
.IP "\fB-V\fP \fIfile\fP[.\fIvpl\fP]"
Same as -v, but the virtual font generated is a caps-and-small-caps font obtained
by scaling uppercase letters by .8 to typeset lowercase. This font
handles accented letters and retains proper kerning.
.SH FILES
.I psfonts.map

.br
.I ../afm/Makefile
in the dvips sources (look at this for examples).

.SH BUGS
An option to add letterspacing to the virtual font was rejected by Knuth
because it would make the fi and fl ligatures break the normal rhythmic pattern.
