This is the latest and greatest version of dvips.  It supports:

	- Automatic generation of fonts via MF whenever needed
	- EPSF PostScript files complete with automatic determination
		of graphics size (see epsf.tex)
	- Literal PostScript includes complete with definitions
	- Non-EPSF PostScript graphics with user-specified scaling
	- TPIC specials
	- Correct budgeting of printer memory
	- Output at 300 or 400 DPI (or any other DPI)
	- Use of PostScript fonts
        - Use of virtual fonts
	- Use of popen on output file.

Usage:

   dvips [options] filename[.dvi]

The output PostScript file is written by default to `filename.ps'.
