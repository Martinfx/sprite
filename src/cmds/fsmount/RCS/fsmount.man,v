.SH NAME
fsmount \- Check disks and export prefixes 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfsmount\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-W\fR" 15
Check disks, but do not write changes.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 15
Don't check disks (fastboot).
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 15
Have both \fBfsmount\fR and \fBfscheck\fR  output verbose information
while running (the default).
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 15
Don't attach disks or export prefixes.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 15
Print out actions but don't execute them.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 15
Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
.IP "\fB\-d \fIdeviceDirectory\fR" 15
Specifies the directory containing the device files.
The default is "/dev/".
.IP "\fB\-i \fIspriteID\fR" 15
Causes prefixes that this machine will export to be preloaded into the
prefix table with \fIspriteID\fR as the server. 
This prevents the machine from broadcasting for its own prefixes while
the disks are being checked.
.IP "\fB\-fscheck \fIfscheckProg\fR" 15
Use this to specify an alternative fscheck program, i.e., when testing
a new fscheck.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 15
Conditionally check the disks.  If the disks were just checked by \fIfscheck\fR
and we are now rebooting, then we don't have to check again.  If the \fB\-c\fR
flag is present then the disks won't be rechecked. 
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBFsmount\fR is used during system boot to check the disks for 
inconsistencies and
to export prefixes.
It is a replacement for \fBfsattach\fR, and is intented to be used without
a mount table.  It uses \fBfsinfo\fR to determine what filesystems are
on the disks connected to the host, \fBfscheck\fR to check the filesystems
found (if they are OFS), and \fBprefix\fR to mount and export them.
In this way, disks can change hosts, change prefixes, or change
parititioning without having to update a mount table file.
.PP
\fBFsmount\fR does some checking before it \fBprefix\fRes filesystems.  If
it finds filesystems whose cylinder extents overlap, it will only
\fBprefix\fR the larger of the filesystems.  If more than one
filesystem has the same prefix, it will try to mount those filesystems
until one successfully mounts and it will ignore the remainder.  If a
filesystem has a prefix of a filesystem already in the prefix table,
it is ignored.
.PP
Currently, \fBfsmount\fR detects and notes root partitions, but does
not try to either check or mount them.
.PP
Upon completion, \fBfsmount\fR creates a \fBfsmounted\fR file in
\fB/hosts/$HOST/fsmounted\fR reporting the filesystems it mounted
and exported, and when it did so.

.SH RETURN CODES
\fBFsmount\fR returns the same error codes as \fBfsattach\fR:
.IP 0
No error.
.IP 1
An error was found in the root partition. Reboot the system. See \fBfscheck\fR
for details.
.IP 2
A hard error occurred. There was some problem in either \fBfsattach\fR, 
\fBfscheck\fR,
or \fBprefix\fR that prevented \fBfsattach\fR from completing normally.
.IP 3 
\fBFscheck\fR returned a soft error indication. See \fBfscheck\fR for details.
.IP 4
An error was found in the root partition, but the number of consecutive
times that \fBfscheck\fR was run and an error found exceeds the limit.

The default behavior is for \fBfsattach\fR to run as many \fBfscheck\fR
jobs in parallel as it can.
The parallelism is limited by the \fIgroup\fR of each device (see below),
and the \fB\-j\fR flag.
If this flag is used then at most \fImaxJobs\fR \fIfscheck\fRs will
be run at a time.

a60 55
The input to \fBfsattach\fR is a mount table, usually in 
\fI/hosts/$HOST/mount\fR.
The location of the mount table is specified by the
\fB\-m\fR option.
\fBFsattach\fR uses the pass information in the mount table to create child
processes that check
the disk partitions using \fBfscheck\fR.
The output from \fBfscheck\fR is appended to a file with the same name as 
the device and the suffix ".fsc".
If \fBfscheck\fR completes normally, 
then the filesystem is mounted and its prefix exported.
.SH MOUNT TABLE 
The mount table contains information on checking the disks and on exporting
prefixes.
Each line in the table consists of a command and its arguments. 
Blank lines and lines that begin with '#' are ignored.
The \fBAttach\fR command is used to check a disk partition and to attach the 
partition to the file system. 
\fBAttach\fR commands have the following format:
.sp
.in 5
\fBAttach\fR \fIprefix\fR \fIdevice\fR \fIgroup\fR \fIscope\fR \fIaccess\fR
.in 0
.LP
\fIPrefix\fR is the prefix under which to mount the partition. 
.LP
The \fIdevice\fR is the
device on which to run fscheck and to attach.
.LP
The \fIgroup\fR parameter is used to determine the parallelism in checking the
disks. \fBFscheck\fR is a very IO constrained application. 
Most of the execution time is spent waiting for the disk. 
If the system has more than one disk the overall run time of \fBfsattach\fR can
be decreased by checking different disks at the same time.
\fIFsattach\fR will run jobs in parallel if possible.
Any partitions that are in the same group  will NOT be checked
in parallel.
A group name is any sequence of characters and is case sensitive.
The group name "root" has special significance.
It is used as the group of the root partition.
This partition is checked before all other partitions, 
and the server may have to reboot if an error is found in this partition.
.LP
The \fIscope\fR can be either local or export. 
Partitions with local scope are attached only for the local machine, 
whereas partitions with export scope are attached and exported under the
given prefix.
The prefix corresponding to the root partition (usually /bootTmp) is
attached during system boot and is not reattached by \fBfsattach\fR.
For this partition the scope parameter does not have any effect.
.LP
The \fIaccess\fR is used to set the access permissions of the prefix. 
If the access is "r" then the prefix is read only. 
If the access is "rw" then the prefix is can be both read and written.
The access parameter has no effect if the partition is the root partition.
d62 7
a68 10
The \fBExport\fR command is used to export a prefix under a different name.
\fBExport\fR commands have the following format:
.sp
.in 5
\fBExport\fR \fIprefix\fR \fIlocalPath\fR 
.in 0
.LP
\fIPrefix\fR is the name of the prefix to be exported.
.LP
\fILocalPath\fR is the name of a path that is to be exported as \fIprefix\fR.
d70 2
a71 14
All other non-comment lines are interpreted as containing arguments to
\fBfscheck\fR.
The format of these lines is:
.sp
.in 5
\fIdeviceName\fR \fI[arguments]\fR
.in 0
.LP
\fIDeviceName\fR is the name of the device for which \fBfscheck\fR is to use the
\fIarguments\fR. A device name of \fBall\fR will cause \fBfscheck\fR to use the 
arguments for all devices. Any number of arguments can follow the device
name, 
as long as they fit on a single line. 
The same device name can appear on any number of lines.

The following is a sample mount table. The root partition is 
\fI/dev/rsd0a\fR and
it is exported under the prefix \fI/t1\fR. 
\fI/t2\fR is another small partition on
the same disk. 
\fI/b\fR is a large partition on the disk, and \fI/a\fR is a large partition
that is an entire second disk.
