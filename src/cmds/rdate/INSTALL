Software Requirements
---------------------

- C compiler

- support for sockets

- at least one machine providing timed service

Installation
------------

1) Unpack the package in an appropriate directory

2) Edit the Makefile to specify the desired configuration items

3) Issue the command 'make' to build the binary

4) Test the program with the following commands (not run as root):

   ./rdate -d server
   ./rdate server

   where server is a machine providing timed service.  The first command
   should display the server's time.  The second should fail with an
   error message: "couldn't set time of day: Not owner".

5) Login as root

6) Repeat the second command from step 4 if you wish to actually set
   the local machine's date

7) Type 'make install' to copy the binary and the man page to the
   directories specified in the Makefile.

8) Modify your system files (e.g., /etc/rc.local or root's crontab)
   as appropriate for your use of rdate
