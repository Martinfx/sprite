.TH BARG 1
.SH NAME
barg \- draw a bar graph in gremlin format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
barg [input_file_name [output_file_name]] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Barg
is used to generate bar graphs in gremlin format.
It takes up to two arguments.  The first argument is the name of the \fIbarg\fP
input file.  The second argument is the name of the gremlin file to store
the output of \fIbarg\fP into.  If the output file is not specified then output
goes to standard output.  If the input file is also missing then input is
read from standard input.
.PP
A \fIbarg\fP input file is an ASCII file containing \fIbarg\fP commands and 
data.  Each command is on a separate line.  White space can be used to
separate the different arguments to each command. 
Lines beginning with a "#" and blank lines are ignored.
All command arguments that affect the dimensions of the graph are specified
in pixels.  
.PP
Graphs are divided up into sets of bars.  Each set can contain from 1 to
8 bars and there can be any number of sets.  The program is fully parameterized
such that the bar width, inner bar spacing, inner set spacing, graph height
and graph width can all be specified.
All parameters that are not specified, except
for the number of sets and the number of bars in each set which must
be specified, will either default to preset values or be calculated.  If the
inner set spacing is not specified or it is specified as -1,
it will be calculated from the bar width,
inner bar spacing and graph width.  Likewise if the inner set spacing
is set but the bar width is not then it will be calculated from the other
parameters.
.PP
The following is a summary of the \fIbarg\fP commands:

The following explains each command in more detail:
.IP b
Define the left and right border in pixels.
The left border width is the number of pixels between the y-axis
and the first bar graph.  The right border width is the number of
pixels that the x-axis extends past the last bar graph.
.IP d
Define a bar graph set.  These commands should be the last commands
in the input file.  The label is the string to draw at the bottom of
the bar graph set.  The following lines up until a line beginning with an
"e" is found are taken as floating point y values for bars in the bar graph
set. The line with the "e" marks the end of the bar graph set.  There cannot
be more than the number of bars per set lines of data between the "d" and
"e" commands.
.IP h
The graph height in pixels.
.IP k
Bar graph key information.  At the bottom of each graph each of the
different bar types is drawn along with the associated label (see the
1-8 commands below).  The left key border specifies the number of pixels
between the y-axis and the first key.  The right key border is the
number of pixels between the end of the x-axis and the rightmost key.
The key width and height define the size of the bar that is drawn that
represents the key.
.IP lx
Label to print on the x-axis.
.IP ly
Label to print on the y-axis.
.IP n
Define the number of bar sets and the number of bars in each set.
This command must come after the dimensions of the graph are defined and
before the data sets are defined with the "d" command.
.IP p
Print a percent sign after each value on the y-axis.
.IP s
Define the number of pixels between each bar and between each set of bars. 
.IP t
Title the graph.
.IP w
The width of the graph in pixels.
.IP y
Define the range of the y-axis.  The # of ticks is the number of pieces
to divide the y-axis into, the delta is the size of each piece and the
starting value is the base value for y.
.IP W
The width of each bar.
.IP [1-8]
Define the type of the ith bar in a set.  The type must be between 0
and 7 and corresponds to the 8 gremlin filled polygon types.
The label is used to print out the bar type key.
