.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script is normally run via
.BR cron .
It checks that the IP server exists and is not in the debugger.  If
that test fails, it invokes a script that kills off the IP server and any
dependent daemons and restarts them all.
.PP
If 
.B /hosts/$HOST/restartIPServer
exists, that script is used as the ``restart'' script.  Otherwise, 
.B /sprite/admin.$MACHINE/restartIPServer 
is used.

.SH KEYWORDS
