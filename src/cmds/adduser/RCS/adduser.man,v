.SH NAME
adduser \- Create a user account
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBadduser\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B adduser
program creates a new user account.  This involves gathering
information for the account (user's name, password, etc.), creating an
entry for the user in the password file, creating and initializing the
user's home directory, and adding the user's account to the
.B sprite-users
mailing list.
.PP
.B Adduser
is basically menu-driven; its usage should be self-explanatory.  If it
runs into problems or you kill it halfway through, it will try to
clean up after itself.

.SH KEYWORDS
user, account
