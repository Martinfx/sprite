.SH NAME
fsattach \- Check disks and export prefixes 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfsattach\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-m \fIfile\fR" 15
Read mount table from \fIfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-W\fR" 15
Check disks, but do not write changes.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 15
Don't check disks (fastboot).
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 15
Ignore group information found in mount table and run \fBfscheck\fR 
sequentially.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 15
Have both \fBfsattach\fR and \fBfscheck\fR  output verbose information
while running.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 15
Don't attach disks or export prefixes.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 15
Print out actions but don't execute them.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 15
Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
.IP "\fB\-d \fIdeviceDirectory\fR" 15
Specifies the directory containing the device files.
The default is "/dev".
.IP "\fB\-k\fR" 15
Produce debugging output.
.IP "\fB\-i \fIspriteID\fR" 15
Causes prefixes that this machine will export to be preloaded into the
prefix table. 
This prevents the machine from broadcasting for its own prefixes while
the disks are being checked.
.IP "\fB\-j \fImaxJobs\fR" 15
The default behavior is for \fBfsattach\fR to run as many \fBfscheck\fR
jobs in parallel as it can.
The parallelism is limited by the \fIgroup\fR of each device (see below),
and the \fB\-j\fR flag.
If this flag is used then at most \fImaxJobs\fR \fIfscheck\fRs will
be run at a time.
.IP "\fB\-fscheck \fIfscheckProg\fR" 15
Use this to specify an alternative fscheck program, i.e. when testing
a new fscheck.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR 15
Conditionally check the disks.  If the disks were just checked by \fIfscheck\fR
and we are now rebooting, then we don't have to check again.  If the \fB\-c\fR
flag is present then the disks won't be rechecked. 
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBFsattach\fR is used during system boot to check the disks for 
inconsistencies and
to export prefixes.
The input to \fBfsattach\fR is a mount table, usually in 
\fI/hosts/$HOST/mount\fR.
The location of the mount table is specified by the
\fB\-m\fR option.
\fBFsattach\fR uses the pass information in the mount table to create child
processes that check
the disk partitions using \fBfscheck\fR.
The output from \fBfscheck\fR is appended to a file with the same name as 
the device and the suffix ".fsc".
If \fBfscheck\fR completes normally, 
then the filesystem is mounted and its prefix exported.
.SH MOUNT TABLE 
The mount table contains information on checking the disks and on exporting
prefixes.
Each line in the table consists of a command and its arguments. 
Blank lines and lines that begin with '#' are ignored.
The \fBAttach\fR command is used to check a disk partition and to attach the 
partition to the file system. 
\fBAttach\fR commands have the following format:
.sp
.in 5
\fBAttach\fR \fIprefix\fR \fIdevice\fR \fIgroup\fR \fIscope\fR \fIaccess\fR
.in 0
.LP
\fIPrefix\fR is the prefix under which to mount the partition. 
.LP
The \fIdevice\fR is the
device on which to run fscheck and to attach.
.LP
The \fIgroup\fR parameter is used to determine the parallelism in checking the
disks. \fBFscheck\fR is a very IO constrained application. 
Most of the execution time is spent waiting for the disk. 
If the system has more than one disk the overall run time of \fBfsattach\fR can
be decreased by checking different disks at the same time.
\fIFsattach\fR will run jobs in parallel if possible.
Any partitions that are in the same group  will NOT be checked
in parallel.
A group name is any sequence of characters and is case sensitive.
The group name "root" has special significance.
It is used as the group of the root partition.
This partition is checked before all other partitions, 
and the server may have to reboot if an error is found in this partition.
.LP
The \fIscope\fR can be either local or export. 
Partitions with local scope are attached only for the local machine, 
whereas partitions with export scope are attached and exported under the
given prefix.
The prefix corresponding to the root partition (usually /bootTmp) is
attached during system boot and is not reattached by \fBfsattach\fR.
For this partition the scope parameter does not have any effect.
.LP
The \fIaccess\fR is used to set the access permissions of the prefix. 
If the access is "r" then the prefix is read only. 
If the access is "rw" then the prefix is can be both read and written.
The access parameter has no effect if the partition is the root partition.
.PP
The \fBExport\fR command is used to export a prefix under a different name.
\fBExport\fR commands have the following format:
.sp
.in 5
\fBExport\fR \fIprefix\fR \fIlocalPath\fR 
.in 0
.LP
\fIPrefix\fR is the name of the prefix to be exported.
.LP
\fILocalPath\fR is the name of a path that is to be exported as \fIprefix\fR.
.PP
All other non-comment lines are interpreted as containing arguments to
\fBfscheck\fR.
The format of these lines is:
.sp
.in 5
\fIdeviceName\fR \fI[arguments]\fR
.in 0
.LP
\fIDeviceName\fR is the name of the device for which \fBfscheck\fR is to use the
\fIarguments\fR. A device name of \fBall\fR will cause \fBfscheck\fR to use the 
arguments for all devices. Any number of arguments can follow the device
name, 
as long as they fit on a single line. 
The same device name can appear on any number of lines.
.PP
The following is a sample mount table. The root partition is 
\fI/dev/rsd0a\fR and
it is exported under the prefix \fI/t1\fR. 
\fI/t2\fR is another small partition on
the same disk. 
\fI/b\fR is a large partition on the disk, and \fI/a\fR is a large partition
that is an entire second disk.

.SH RETURN CODES
\fBFsattach\fR returns one of the following codes upon exit.
.IP 0
No error.
.IP 1
An error was found in the root partition. Reboot the system. See \fBfscheck\fR
for details.
.IP 2
A hard error occurred. There was some problem in either \fBfsattach\fR, 
\fBfscheck\fR,
or \fBprefix\fR that prevented \fBfsattach\fR from completing normally.
.IP 3 
\fBFscheck\fR returned a soft error indication. See \fBfscheck\fR for details.
.IP 4
An error was found in the root partition, but the number of consecutive
times that \fBfscheck\fR was run and an error found exceeds the limit.

Pass numbers start at 0 and increase. Pass 0 is restricted to the root
partition. There are no restrictions on the other passes. It is up to the

in a sensible manner.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
.PP
\fBFsattach\fR reads a configuration file during startup. 
The standard file is \fI/local/bootBin/fsattach.config\fR, although this can
be changed using the \fB\-c\fR option. 
The use of a configuration file is optional. It only exists so that
certain internal variables of fsattach can be modified.
Entries in the file consists of a variable name and its new value.
Lines that are blank or start with '#' are ignored.
The following variables are valid.
.IP "\fBmountTableSize \fIsize\fR" 5
Changes the maximum number of entries in the mount table. The default is
30.
.IP "\fBrootTempOutputFile \fIfile\fR" 5
When \fBfscheck\fR checks the root partition it stores its output in a
preallocated,
temporary file. This output is later copied into the correct place.
See \fBfscheck\fR for more details.
The default  is ".fscheck.out".
.IP "\fBrootTempOutputFileSize \fIsize\fR" 5
Sets the size of the temporary output file to \fIsize\fR bytes. 
If the output from \fBfscheck\fR exceeds this limit then the extra is discarded.
The size of the temporary file must not cause the file to require more
data blocks than the maximum number of direct blocks.
The default is 8192 bytes.
.IP "\fBheapLimit \fIlimit\fR" 5
The size of the heap used by \fBfscheck\fR is constrained to be less than 
\fIlimit\fR.
The default is 1000000. See \fBfscheck\fR for details.
.IP "\fBoutputDir \fIdir\fR" 5
Changes the directory where the output from \fBfscheck\fR is stored. 
The default is \fI/local\fR.
.IP "\fBfscheck \fIcommand\fR" 5
Makes \fIcommand\fR the command that is executed to run \fBfscheck\fR. 
The default is \fI/local/bootBin/fscheck\fR.
