There are some frequently asked questions about the programs
available from garbo.uwasa.fi, by anonymous ftp, from the /pc/..
directories here at the University of Vaasa, Finland, site
128.214.87.1.  Below you will find many of them prerecorded with
answers.  Please notice that the questions & answers are not in any
logical order.  The order has more or less been dictated by the
arriving questions.  And, there is overlapping.

If you are well familiar with FTP and mail servers please note the
following. Using automated FTP (batchftp) is preferred, since it
minimizes the connection time (it is convenient for you, anyway).
Furthermore, use mail servers *ONLY* if you don't have the FTP
potential.

Subject: What is anonymous FTP

1. *****
 Q: I do not understand this getting files with anonymous ftp.  What
does it mean?

 A: FTP stands for file transfer program, which is a standard
feature in many mainframe Unix and VAX/VMS systems.  It also means
that you must have a network connection to reach the University of
Vaasa.  Please contact your computer's system manager for more
information on the connection.  When this is ok, just follow the
instructions in Appendix A at the end of this prerecorded message.

Subject: Email server instructions

2. *****
 Q: Many of us users have no ftp access.  Would you please send
programs to me by email.

 A1: To get files sent to you by email, please use our mail server.
 To get more information write a message to mailserv@garbo.uwasa.fi.
 The subject line of this message must be
   garbo-request
 The message must contain just the following text (at the beginning
of the line):
   send help
 Do not include a signature because it may confuse the server.
 If you do not understand, please don't send the mail server request.
 If you have ftp capability, please use FTP only, since it causes
less load.

 A2: Our customary format for the file names when announcing
 programs for ANONYMOUS FTP is e.g.
    garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/dirutil/dirmat20.zip  or
    /pc/dirutil/dirmat20.zip
 IMPORTANT!!! The format for the MAIL SERVER is slightly different:
    send pc/dirutil/dirmat20.zip
 In other words omit / from the path when using our mail server.
 ....
Here are some common examples of INCORRECT requests:
    send pc/dirutil/dirmat20.arc
The format is correct, but there is no such file. Look at the file
list more carefully.
 ....
    send pc/dirutil/dirmat19.zip
The format is correct, but the package has just been updated with a
more recent version. Look at the directory list again.
 ....
    send /pc/dirutil/dirmat20.zip
    send dirutil/dirmat20.zip
The directory path is incorrect.
 ....
    send pc/ts/dirmat20.zip
The format is correct, but the file is not in that directory.
 ....
    send pc/dirutil/DIRMAT20.ZIP
The system is case sensitive. Almost all the files and all the
directories are lower case.
 ....
    send pc/dirutil/dirmat*.zip
No wildcards.

Subject: Poor souls without FTP

3. *****
 Q: Why announce programs in the UseNet newsgroups when many users
do not have the ftp capability?

 A1: Look at it this way.  I know this is a problem.  In fact I once
had an interesting and lengthy email discussion with one user about
this dilemma.  Let me put forward my own view about the c.b.i.p
newsgroups.  I feel that the primary purpose of groups like these is
(or should be) to disseminate and exchange useful information about
PC programs.  A secondary purpose is to exchange information about
getting files.  In getting the files there are five major
alternatives, that is posting in binaries, ftp, emailing between
users, using mail servers, and BBSes.  What this amounts to is that
even if you do not have the ftp capability, the information may give
you useful hints what programs to look for via the many alternative
methods of getting the files.

 A2: The garbo file collection is also available on a CDROM which
can be obtained from WasaWare Oy, Harri Valkama, Palosaarentie 31,
SF-65200 VAASA, FINLAND, Telephone & Fax: 358-61-173365, Email:

Subject: Are all programs announced

4. *****
 Q: Do you announce all your new programs in the UseNet news?

 A: Not quite.  With the exception of the programs in the /pc/ts
directory (which have always been announced) we have announced
programs that we have felt particularly interesting for one reason
or another.  This also goes for the uploads that users make to us,
but since the beginning of 1992 we have tried to post all the upload
announcements (cf question 10 and /pc/UPLOAD.INF).  But do take a
look at /pc/_files.in. It gives a monthly list of all our new MsDos
files.

Subject: FTP transfer commands

5. *****
 Q: I have the ftp (file transfer program) capability and a network
access that includes your 128.214.87.1 site garbo.uwasa.fi.  But
how do I transfer the files? What are the commands?

 A: The information and examples in Appendix A of this message
should enable you to get the files.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

From ts@uwasa.fi Tue 26 May 00:00:06 1992
Subject: Allegedly corrupt packages

6. *****
 Q: I have received the programs but the package is corrupt.  When I
try to unpack them with my unpacking program (pkxarc, pkunpak, arc,
pkunzip, lharc, zoo, arj, etc.) the unpacking fails or produces
files that lock my PC.

A: The files with the .zip, .zoo, .arc, .arj, .lzh, .pak, and .exe
extension are binary packages and you have to use the correct
transfer mode when you transfer the programs from the remote FTP
site to our host, and when you transfer the files from our main
frame to your PC.
   Very frequently the problems the users report are due to failing
to set the binary mode when transferring the files from the user's
host to the users PC.  Please see Appendix B for more information.
There have been over million of successful downloads a year from us,
and it is very unlikely that the original file at garbo.uwasa.fi is
really corrupted.  It is not impossible, but first check all the
other possibilities.  Perhaps the most common error is failing to
make the transfer binary.
   There is another common cause for allegedly corrupt packages
besides failing to use the correct mode in the file transfer from
the FTP site to one's own host, or in the file transfer from one's
own host to one's PC.  This is failing to use the correct version of
the relevant archiver for archived packages.  In particular, if a
.zip file at the FTP site has been constructed with Unix zip version
1.0, and you try to unzip it with old (pre 1.1) PKZIP versions,
you'll get an error message indicating a CRC error.  This is a
misleading error message since it really is an incompatible version
error.

Subject: SIMTEL20 questions

7. *****
 Q: I would rather like to get the files from SIMTEL20 (or some
other archive site near me) since I have an easier access there.
Send me a list telling in which directories the files are at
SIMTEL20 or some other near-by FTP archive.

 A: We are often asked this (and other) information about SIMTEL20.
We like to and do cooperate much with SIMTEL20, but nevertheless
this is really something you should be finding out from SIMTEL20,
not us.  SIMTEL20 archives maintainer is Keith Petersen
w8sdz@vela.acs.oakland.edu. The SIMTEL20 filelist to get is
PD1:<MSDOS.FILEDOCS>SIMLIST.ARC.
  North American downloaders should first try one of the many
archives in the USA such as SIMTEL20 and wuarchive.wustl.edu instead
of overseas sites to cut down the load on the overseas link.  For
the other users the reciprocal seems logical.  First take a look at
garbo.uwasa.fi archives (or some other European site).  There is a
good list of MsDos FTP sites in garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/pd2/moder*.lst.

Subject: What is garbo's guest user-id

8. *****
 Q: Do you have a guest user-id? I cannot ftp, but I can reach your
site through the net.  I type anonymous at the login: and then try
to give my email address at the Password:.  I am not let in, but get
a "Login incorrect" message instead.

 A: We do not accept guest users.  This means that what you tried,
is not allowed at our site.  The only way you can get connected to
our system is using the true ftp system, which is described in
Appendix A.

From ts@uwasa.fi Tue 26 May 00:00:09 1992
Subject: The .arc .arj .lzh .pak .zip .zoo extensions

9. *****
 Q: I now have the files, but they have this .arc (or .arj, .lzh,
.pak, .zip, .zoo) extension and they won't run then I write their
name at my DOS prompt.

 A: The files are packed (also often called archived) entities.
These are special formats of compressing files and packing several
files together.  This is usually standard knowledge for PC users,
and if you are not familiar with the system, just ask a
knowledgeable fellow user.  What you need is the proper unpacking
programs such as ARJ, ARC, PKXARC, PKUNPAK, PKUNZIP, PAK, LHARC,
LHA,ZOO and so on.  And, you will find all the necessary tools for
handling packed files in the /pc/arcers directory.  For example, if
the extension is .zip get the self-extracting pkz110eu.exe utility
(or whatever is latest version).
   Note that if you use an out of date PKUNZIP version, it may
report a CRC error in your .zip file although the true reason for
your problems is using the out of date version.

Subject: Upload instructions

10. *****
 Q: I have made some programs myself which I think might be of
general interest.  Or I have obtained this fabulous program which I
think would be of general interest.  Or I have a more recent version
of this program than you have on your archives.  Would it be
possible to upload them to your system.

 A: Please see garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/UPLOAD.INF and /pc/UPTEXT.INF for
the full information on this question.  In brief, we welcome quality
MsDos uploads in many but not all categories. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

From ts@uwasa.fi Tue 26 May 00:00:11 1992
Subject: Need file descriptions

11. *****
 Q: Is there a description of the programs? I would like to have
some information on the files before I start transferring them.

 A1: Yes, certainly.  This approach is even recommended.  There is a
file called /pc/INDEX.ZIP (with MsDos eolns) which is the annotated
list of the MsDos files on garbo.  This index file is also available
in the (more bloated) ascii format as /pc/INDEX and Unix compressed
format /pc/filelist/garboidx.Z (Unix eolns). Furthermore, there are
three news files /pc/pd2/news-pd2, /pc/ts/0news-ts, and
/unix/ts/0news-u. Note that /pc/pd2/news-pd2 contains selected news
on all /pc (MsDos) directories, not just on /pc/pd2.  Finally there
is a /pc/INDEXTS.ZIP. It contains detailed information on the
contents of each package in the /pc/ts directory.  For the annotated
contents of our Unix directories see /unix/INDEX.

 A2: Even if I like to try to help whenever I can, I cannot answer
questions asking me to describe particular files, or to take a
closer look what is in them on behalf of an individual user.  I
simply cannot afford the time.

Subject: Problems with sending replys

12. *****
 Q: I sent you a message a couple of weeks ago.  Did you receive it?
Why don't you reply?

 A: I try to reply to all queries I have received.  But getting the
reply to you successfully is not always technically possible.  The
reason for this is, that the reply address which the mail program
gives, is sometimes not adequate.  My reply bounces back to me as a
consequence.  Therefore you should include your InterNet and/or
BitNet address in your message.  Using proper signatures in email is
customary, anyway.  This does not guarantee a successful reply, but
it definitely increases the possibility of getting an eventual
reply.
   Since 1991 I have had to backtrack on this promise.  I now get so
much email that if my reply bounces I simply can't afford the time
to try to fix it.  So if you don't hear from me within a week,
contact your own system manager.  Ask him/her to see to it that your
email address in your message header is a returnable address.

Subject: Unknown packing methods

13. *****
 Q: When I try to unpack the package I get something like an
"unknown packing method" error message.  What is wrong?

 A: First check that you are using the correct unpacking program by
looking at the extension of the file name, and select the unpacking
program accordingly.  If this does not help, you are most likely
using an outdated version of the relevant unpacking program.  Get
the latest version.  The /pc/arcers directory at garbo.uwasa.fi has
a good collection of these tools.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

From ts@uwasa.fi Tue 26 May 00:00:14 1992
Subject: Looking for particular programs

14. *****
 Q: I am interested to know if there exists a program for such and
such purpose.  Would you point me in the right direction.  (This
question also often occurs in the news postings, especially in
the comp.binaries.ibm.pc.wanted newsgroup.)

 A1: Most often the best answer is to look through file lists.  We
have several such lists which should together have quite a good
coverage of the PD programs in circulation.  These lists are
/pc/INDEX.ZIP and /pc/INDEXTS.ZIP (these are the MsDos file lists
for our site, garbo.uwasa.fi), /pc/filelist/cbbs_dos.zip,
/pc/filelist/files-mm.zip (a good English speaking Finnish BBS), and
/pc/filelist/simlist.zip (SIMTEL20 list).

A2: How to find MsDos files on garbo.uwasa.fi: If you are looking
for a particular program at garbo.uwasa.fi you should start by
getting the following files:
   /pc/INDEX.ZIP       (/pc/INDEX in the heavier ascii form)
   /pc/INDEXTS.ZIP     (ts-package contents)
 For seeing what is new in the /pc and /pc/ts directories, get
   /pc/pd2/news-pd2    (selected news on all MsDos directories)
   /pc/ts/0news-ts     (all news on ts-programs)

A3: There is more advice on finding files in the Frequently Asked
Questions collection /pc/ts/tsfaq28.zip (or whatever version number
is current), and the garbo feedback files /pc/pd2/post##.lst (where
## = 01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09 at the time of writing this).

From ts@uwasa.fi Tue 26 May 00:00:15 1992
Subject: Files with .Z extension

15. *****
 Q: I have noticed that some directories at garbo.uwasa.fi archives
include files that have a .Z extension.  What are they?

 A1: They are Unix files that are processed with compress,
uncompress, and zcat.  The garbo.uwasa.fi archives are on a Unix
system, and many these files are related to handling the PC files
without having first to transfer them to from the Unix mainframe to
the PC.  Please see /unix/ts/0news-u and /pc/ts/tsfaq28.zip (or
whatever is the current version number) for more details and
instructions.  Also try
   man compress
on a Unix system for information.

 A2: You can handle these compressed files also on your MsDos PC.
For that you need a program like /pc/unix/comp430d.zip (or whatever
version is the latest).  Note for text files that Unix and MsDos use
different eolns (end-of-lines).  You may filter them properly eg
with unix2pc.exe which is in /pc/ts/tsfilt19.zip (or whatever
version number is current).

Subject: File list of unavailable files

16. *****
 Q: Exactly where does one obtain the files listed in files-mm.zip?
There didn't seem to be any indication to that effect in the
FILES.TXT file, and I'm almost certain you don't keep them at
garbo.uwasa.fi...

 A: They are available at FidoNet node 2:220/22, Micro Maniacs Opus,
Finland, phone 358-0-463636.  The reason for having files-mm.zip is
to have a file list of one good BBS so that the users can look what
kind of files are available in one good bulletin board, even if
SIMTEL20 or garbo.uwasa.fi do not have all these files.  There is
also a huge file list of another BBS on garbo.uwasa.fi archives,
that is /pc/filelist/cbbs_dos.zip.  The phone is 358-0-5063329.

From ts@uwasa.fi Tue 26 May 00:00:17 1992
Subject: I cannot make the connection

17. *****
 Q: What if my site does not know garbo or connection refused? 
(This question comes in various formats, but the point of all the
queries is that the user cannot connect to garbo). 

A: Garbo, the system, is managed by Harri Valkama (hv@uwasa.fi), and
our main system chyde is managed by Hannu Hirvonen (hh@uwasa.fi) who
is also our postmaster.  Timo Salmi specializes in garbo publicity,
and MsDos material.  Nevertheless, here is some general information. 
   In general if you are having problems in reaching garbo (not
problems with garbo itself) the first person to contact is your own
site's system manager.  For example, if you might get an error
message like "host unknown".  This means that your own host does not
know garbo.uwasa.fi.  The garbo information is missing from your
site's hosts-file, and your host is not using distributed name
service.  There is nothing we can do about from this end.  (You can
try to use the IP number 128.214.87.1 in that case as a temporary
measure). 
   You might also get a more radical error message like "Access to
the Scandinavian nodes has been discontinued, due to the slowness
and unreliability of the network connections." Again this is a
problem that has nothing to do directly with garbo.  It is probably
a question of your site's net privileges and arrangements, or a
problem between different networks quite beyond our control.

Subject: Automated downloads (see this)

18. *****
 Q: The ftp session is repetitive and tedious, and the connection is
not always available.  Is there any way to automate getting files
from garbo.uwasa.fi by anonymous ftp.

 A: Yes, there is a useful facility called batchftp by Shawn Cooper,
which achieves this if you have a BSD Unix system.  You can get it
by downloading /unix/ftp/batchftp102.tar.Z (or whatever version is
the latest).  The package contains documentation, and also see
/unix/ftp/batchftp.inf and /unix/ts/0news-u for brief instructions.
This system has the added advantage of cutting down the unnecessary
idle time inherent in "manual" ftp connections.

Subject: Problems with mail server requests

19. *****
 Q: I sent a mail server request to garbo.uwasa.fi but I get no
response at all.  And I am sure that I did everything as instructed.

 A: In that case your, or your system's email address is probably
badly configured. Please contact your own system manager.
   DON'T send a repeat request until your email address problem has
been resolved!!!  This is very important, so I repeat DON'T!
   What happens is this.  We get your request, but when
garbo.uwasa.fi tries to honor your request to send you the file(s)
by email, the email bounces back to us because of the problems in
your email address.  If you send repeat requests, it will just clog
our post-master with the bounced email.
   Try using a corrected mail address to return the requests.  You
can do this by adding the following command to (the body of) your
message to our mail server.
    path <path to your machine>
 e.g.
    path youruserid@yourmachine.yourdomain.yourcountry
    send WhateverYouWant
You should contact your system manager to asses an optimized path
especially if you are using UUCP or BANG paths to get your mail
delivered to us. Our mail server checks the mail queue every 15
minutes so if you don't get response in a reasonable time you'd
better check this one out with a little help from your friends. You
can use this command with or without the <> characters.

Subject: Garbo mirrors

20. *****
 Q: Are garbo files mirrored?  Which directories? How to connect?

 A: Garbo is mirrored in North America by wuarchive.wustl.edu. 
Oceanian users are referred to the archie.au mirror.  The mirrors
are independent operations.  Therefore you should direct any
detailed questions about the mirroring to the relevant moderators of
those sites, not to us.  Note, however, that much of what is in
Appendix A on how to download the files is directly applicable to
the mirrors as well.  See garbo.uwasa.fi: /pc/pd2/moder*.lst for
preliminary information on the main mirror directories, and the
mirror moderators' email addresses.  
   Also note that there is no guarantee that the mirror will not lag
even week(s) behind, _or_ might not have all the files.

 Q: The answer to my question is not in this list, what next?

 A: It depends very much on your question.  Try take a look at the
/pc/ts/tsfaq28.zip (or whichever version is current) Frequently
Asked Questions and the /pc/pd2/post*.txt (* = 01,02,...) garbo
information files.  If these do not help document your problem
carefully.  Please note that I cannot guarantee that we have the
answer, or that I will have the time to look for it. I like to help,
but I often simply cannot afford the time. Therefore you should save
a copy of your question so that you can consider posting it to the

Subject: Appendix A: FTP downloading

A. *****
 Q: APPENDIX A: Obtaining (downloading) the Programs by FTP
 ==========================================================

   You can obtain the file(s) from garbo.uwasa.fi (128.214.87.1)
using the InterNet ftp (file transfer program) with username
"anonymous".  For a login password use your electronic mail address.
If you are using ftp from a VAX/VMS system, set case lower before
proceeding.
   Consider as an example the programs of Timo Salmi.  The files are
in directory /pc/ts.  At the ftp> prompt first type binary (for
binary files).  To go to the relevant directory apply cd /pc/ts.  To
see its contents apply ls or dir.  To download a file, use get
filename or mget filenames.  The files have been packed with Unix
Zip so on MsDos you will need PKUNZIP from PKWARE or some other
unzip program to unpack them on your PC.
   The following contains the same information by giving the
commands needed for transferring vaasa.inf (contains text on
Finland, Vaasa, and University of Vaasa) and tspfon29.zip as an
example.  In the example its is assumed that you are calling from a
Unix system.  The usage for a VAX/VMS system is quite similar.

ftp                   #Invoke the file transfer program
open 128.214.87.1     #Connect to garbo.uwasa.fi at the University
                      #of Vaasa
anonymous             #Use this name to get temporary privileges
Give your email address as your password
cd /pc/ts             #Go to the relevant directory
dir  (or ls -lF)      #Directory of available files
ascii                 #vaasa.inf is an ordinary text file
get vaasa.inf         #Copy the file to your default directory
binary                #tspfon29.zip is a binary file
mget tspfon*.zip      #mget allows wildcards
close                 #Terminate the connection
quit                  #Quit the file transfer program

Subject: Appendix B: Your host -> your PC

B. *****
 Q: APPENDIX B: Transferring the Programs to PC
 ==============================================
   After you have received the files to your host, there still
remains the task of transferring the programs to your PC.  This is
familiar to most users, but occasionally there are problems.  It
impossible to give advice that would cover resolving all the
difficulties, but the most common can be described.  The most usual
file transfer method between the host and the user's PC is MsKermit.
(Zmodem and others may be used as well, but I would guess that most
often persons using these alternatives are advanced users, and can
resolve any problems by themselves.)
   The most common problem is probably that after getting a packed
file to one's PC, the file appears damaged.  Almost always this is
due to failing to set correctly the Kermit parameters at ONE or BOTH
ends of the transfer.  What you have to do is the following.  In
your host Kermit set file type binary, set parity even (or none or
whatever), and in your PC MsKermit you must have the SAME parity you
set for your host (select host Kermit parity on the basis of your
PC's).  If you fail to get these compatible, the transfer will not
result in what you want.  Transferring text files does not lead to
problems so often.  The trick is set file type text (or ascii
depending on your Kermit version).
   Finally, if nothing else, absolutely nothing else(!), seems to
resolve the problem, please let us know, and we will check that the
file at our site is good and proper.
