Tue 21-Jul-92: I have updated the program review file to be
 31469 Jul 21 23:34 garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/pd2/review08.zip

and Peter Breuer's review of Dan Lewis's LastByte.

file since it was missing the index.

The tenth is still under construction, and currently holds 11/30
messages

Fri 10-Jul-92: Rhys Weatherley and I have again updated our list of
MsDos FTP sites this time adding a new item on an Australian site.
The file is 8315 Jul 10 22:45 garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/pd2/moder13.zip.

Wed 1-Jul-92: I have moved the 1-Jan-92 to 30-Jun-92 garbo.uwasa.fi
news file /pc/pd2/news-pd2 to /pc/pd2/news92a.pd2.  The news-pd2
file will thus contain news from 1-Jul-92 on.  The reason for not
waiting until the end of the year is the amount of material that has
piled up during the first half of 1992.
