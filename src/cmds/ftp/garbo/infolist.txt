This information is above all directed to long-standing users of
garbo.uwasa.fi, preferably with an upload record, or some other
background of mutually useful communication with garbo moderators. 

Tue 4-Feb-92: If you are interested in having your email address
added to the garbo-infolist upload accouncement, download
statistics, etc news list you are welcome to email me an
"application".  Your application must include the following line
  YourFirstName YourLastName = youruserid@machine.domain.country
eg mine would be
  Timo Salmi = ts@chyde.uwasa.fi 
Be very careful to get this information right.  It is absolutely
essential.  Unless we know each other well from earlier contacts on
the net, you should also clearly state your status, affiliation, and
reasons for wanting to be on this list, since I cannot make this a
completely open offer.  Eg I would state
  Professor of Accounting and Business Finance
  School of Business Studies, University of Vaasa, Finland
  I want to help in propagation of shareware and PD MsDos programs
  and in order to do that I need information of the new uploads to
  your anonymous ftp archives.  I would get selected files from your
  list, and put them up for general download on my system.
  (Then eg some information about my computer usage background,
   etc).
	
Mon 24-Jun-91: Note that not all our new files are announced on
garbo-infolist (nor the news) but only a select set of interesting
files.  Thus you might also be interested in occasionally looking
at the raw list /pc/_files.in at your own pace.
