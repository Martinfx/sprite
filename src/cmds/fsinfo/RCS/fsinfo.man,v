.SH NAME
fsinfo \- prints file system info found on disk partitions
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfsinfo\fR
[\fI-verbose\fR]
\fIdevice\fR
[\fIdevice ...\fR]
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-verbose\fR 15
Allow fsinfo to complain.
.IP "\fIdevice\fR" 15
The device specifying the disk partition, e.g., /dev/rsd00a.  
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 15
Print a summary of the command-line options and exits.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
fsinfo tries to read partition and file system information from the
devices specified on the command line.  It first determines the 
type of the file system, if any, found on the device.  If a file system
is found, fsinfo reports the type of file system,
the last domain prefix that the device was mounted as, the domain
number of the file system, the Sprite ID of the machine it was
last mounted on, and the start cylinder and the number of cylinders
of the partition on which the file system resides.
.PP
Since disk partitions can overlap, fsinfo may find the same file system
on two different devices even though the file system was created on only one.
If the user sets the \fI\-verbose\fR option, fsinfo reports an error
if a file system is found on a different partition than the one it was
created on.  
If no file system is found on a device, a message is printed to that
effect.  Note also that fsinfo prints an error message if the device
specifies the entire disk, e.g., /dev/rsd00, since file systems are
not created on disks, but rather on partitions.

.IP \fB\-mismatch\fR
Print whatever file system information is found on the given partition.
.IP \fB\-match\fR
Only print file system information if found on the partition the file system 
was created on.
.IP \fB\-nohead\fR
Do not print the column header.
.IP \fB\-quiet\fR
Do not print out error messages, effectively skipping the partitions.

created on.  With the \fI\-mismatch\fR option, fsinfo doesn't check to
see if the specified partition is the creation partition, and prints
out the file system information anyway.  The default behavior of
fsinfo is determined by the number of device arguments.  If there
is one device argument, fsinfo defaults to \fI\-match\fR mode, but
if there is more than one argument it defaults to \fI\-mismatch\fR mode.
.PP
a42 6
With the \fI\-quiet\fR option set, no error messages are printed.  
Any device that would cause fsinfo to print a message is skipped, as
if it were never sent to fsinfo originally.
.PP
The \fI-nohead\fR option suppresses the printing of the column
header.
