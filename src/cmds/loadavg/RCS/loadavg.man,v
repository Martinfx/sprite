loadavg \- Interface to the migration load average and idle time database
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBloadavg\fR \fB\-a \fR

\fBloadavg\fR \fB\-E \fR

.SH INTRODUCTION
This command is used to provide user access to the migration load
average and idle 
time database.  It may be used to retrieve information about the local
host or all hosts on the network, invalidate entries in the migration
database,
or evict foreign processes.  The default for \fBloadavg\fR if invoked with
no arguments is to list the load average of the local host.  This is
also true if the program is invoked as \fBla\fR or \fBuptime\fR, which
are synonyms to make \fBloadavg\fR somewhat compatible with UNIX.  If the
program is invoked as \fIevict\fR, the default is to evict foreign
processes. 
.SH "RETRIEVING INFORMATION"
.IP "\fB\-l\fR"
.IP "\fB\-a\fR"
When invoked with the \fB\-l\fR flag, or with no arguments, \fBloadavg\fR
will print a line containing information about the local host.  
The \fB-a\fR flag is used to list information about all hosts.  
Each
line contains the hostname; machine type; machine status; migration
status; 
1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute weighted load averages; and time
since input was last received at the console, for idle hosts.  
Times are given in the
form ``days+hours:minutes''.
For hosts that are running, the machine status is listed as ``up''
followed by the time since they last rebooted.  The migration status
is ``inuse'' for hosts with one or more active local users, ``avail''
for hosts that are available for migration, ``hasmig''for hosts that
are currently running processes that are migrated from other hosts,
and ``refuses'' for hosts that are idle but are refusing migration
(perhaps because they are running an incompatible version of the
kernel, or because they are file servers).  
In addition, for
hosts that are currently available for migration from the host
invoking \fBloadavg\fR, a \fB*\fR is printed next to the hostname.
After the migration status, \fBloadavg\fR lists the weighted load
averages and time since last input.  Note: idle times of less than the
threshold for permitting migration are not listed, and input from
remote logins does not affect host idle time.
Finally, the machine status is ``down'' for hosts that are not currently
running, in which case the host is listed with the time since it was
last running.
.SH "INVALIDATING INFORMATION"
.IP "\fB\-Z \fIhost ...\fR"
To invalidate the entries for one or more hosts in the shared
migration database, invoke \fBloadavg\fR with the \fB\-Z\fR option,
followed by the names of the hosts to invalidate.  This may be used if
a host is removed from the network, for example.  Hosts that are not
invalidated but are down indefinitely will appear in the list of hosts
as being down.
.SH "EVICTION"
.IP "\fB\-E\fR"
Running \fBloadavg\fR with the \fB\-E\fR option causes it to evict foreign processes
as though the machine were no longer idle.  If \fBloadavg\fR is invoked by the
name \fIevict\fR,  eviction is the default operation.
Eviction is performed by invoking an ioctl on the pseudo-device
corresponding to the host-specific \fBmigd\fR daemon.

no arguments is to list the load average of the local host, but if the
program is invoked as \fIevict\fR, the default is to evict foreign

automatically evict foreign processes when input is detected after a
period of inactivity.

.SH "UPDATING INFORMATION (DAEMON MODE)"
.IP "\fB\-d\fR"
At boot time, each host invokes the \fBloadavg\fR program in daemon mode.
The program will detach itself and run in the background.
The program will mark the host as unavailable for migration 
regardless of load and idle time if the \fB\-r\fR flag is specified.
.br
The program runs as long as the host is up, and it periodically
updates both the private and shared migration databases. (Refer to the
mig library for more information about these databases.)  Information
in the private file is updated each time the load is sampled,
currently every five seconds.  The shared database is updated once
each minute or when the migration status of the host changes from
accepting to refusing migrations or vice-versa.   
.br
If a host is idle and input is then
detected, foreign processes are automatically evicted.  If the
\fB\-v\fR flag is specified in daemon mode, then evictions are
verbose, and the processID, userID, and hostID of each foreign process
is printed as the process is evicted.  If not in verbose mode, only a
summary of the number of processes evicted will appear.  In each case,
the information appears in the syslog of the host doing the eviction.

.IP "\fB\-a\fR"
Use this flag to list information about all hosts.  Hosts that are up
will be shown with information like that described above for the local
host.  Hosts that are down will be shown as ``down'', along with the
time since they were last up.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR"
This flag indicates that the \fBloadavg\fR program should output the Sprite
ID of a host that is available for process migration.  To be available
for migration, the host must be the same architecture as the local
host, have a low load average, have no recent keyboard input, and be
willing to accept processes for migration.
If the \fB\-v\fR flag is specified along with \fB\-i\fR, the program
will print ``No idle node found'' if no host is available.  Otherwise,
if no host is available, nothing will be printed.
.br
Typically, programs such as \fIpmake\fP access the migration database 
directly to select idle machines.
