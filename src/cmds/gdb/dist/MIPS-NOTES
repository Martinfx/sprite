This is the alpha release of the gdb port to MIPS-based machines.
Only the (little-endian) DECstation3100 has been tested.

Here I will try to list known problems:

Calling a function in the debugger (as in 'print f(x)') normally
works correctly. One known exception is if you pass a structure
argument whose sizeof > 4. Currently, gdb will align it on
an 8-byte boundary, while the compiler while depend on
the alignment needed by the fields. (Unfortunately, the
distributed varargs.h and stdarg.h are inconsistent with
mips' compiler!)

Fortran debugging could be made nicer, but a lot of that is a
problem with the implementation-independent gdb.

Code in include files is handled poorly (missing line numbers).

Lots of testing is needed.
E.g. is IN_SIGTRAMP (in infrun.c) correct?
