.SH NAME
gcore \- Generate a core file from a Sprite process.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBgcore\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIpid pid ...\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-o\fI prefix\fR" 10
Generate the output file names by prepending the string 
\fIprefix\fR to each of the pids.
.IP "\fB\-k\fR"
Kill the process after the core dump is produced.
.IP "\fB\-s \fIsignal\fR"
Use signal number \fIsignal\fR to pause running process.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBGcore\fR generates a snapshot of the current execution state
of a Sprite process.
For historical reasons,
these snapshot are referred to as core dumps or core files.
Core dumps can be used by the \fBgdb\fR debugger to 
examine the process's state as if the debugger was attached
to the process.
.LP
\fBGcore\fR takes as arguments one or more process ids and 
generates core dumps for each process in the file core.\fIpid\fR
where \fIpid\fR is the specified process id.
The \fB-o\fR option allows a string other than "core" to be
used to generate output file names.
If the \fB-k\fR option is specified, the processes specified will
be sent a SIGKILL signal after the core dump is finished. 
.LP
\fBGcore\fR reads the register state and memory image of a
process by using the Sprite debugger 
interface (\fBProc_Debug\fR.) 
If the process is not already in the DEBUG state (see the \fBps\fR command),
\fBgcore\fR will send the process a SIGTRAP signal to force 
it into the DEBUG state.  
This operation will fail if the user does not have permission to 
send signals to the process or the 
process has blocked, ignored, or has a handler installed for the SIGTRAP signal.
The \fB-s\fR option can be used to inform \fBgcore\fR
to use a signal number other than 5 (SIGTRAP).
Other signals that may work are 4 (SIGILL), 8 (SIGFPE) and 11 (SIGSEGV).
\fBGcore\fR restarts running process by sending them a SIGCONT after
the dump is produced.
.SH WARNING
The signals used by \fBgcore\fR  to stop running processes
can interrupt system calls such 
as \fBread, select\fR, or \fBsleep\fR, 
causing them to return an error status of EINTR. 
Some programs may interpret the EINTR as an error and exit.
