		Using PostScript Illustrations in TeX

    TeX provides an unstandardized interface directly to the printer
drivers to support illustartions (and possibly extensions) in a non-
standard way.  This mecanism, called \special, is interpreted by the
printer driver for PostScript printers to be the name of a file of
PostScript code to be interpolated at that point in the document.

    When the file is being interpolated, the origin is placed at the
left edge and ``current V'' in the dvi file.  This is the place where
the next character will be placed if the user goes into horizontal mode.
This means that you should write your PostScript programs so that
the image lies along the bottom of the page, and in the center.

    Also, the PostScript files should NOT contain any showpage
commands.  A copypage would be okay, but doesn't make much sense.

    Any PostScript commands are okay, even those that change the
CTM, since the driver brackets the user PostScript code with
gsave/grestore.  It is best though, to make sure the opstack has
not been changed when your illustration is done.

    One thing to worry about; the printer driver needs to access
the file by the name given (and it will NOT run in the user's
current directory (unless that's /usr/spool/??d) and may not even
run on the user's machine).  Thus, one must make sure that the
printer is being spooled from the current machine, and that the
full pathname of the file is specified (no tildes, please).
If neither of these conditions is practical, the user will have
to run dvi2ps by hand.  Here is an exaple command sequence that
will format and print the dvifile pspicture.dvi on the printer
"ps":

	% dvi2ps pspicture.dvi > /tmp/dvi$$ps
	[1]
	% cat /usr/local/lib/ps/psdvi.pro /tmp/dvi$$ps | lpr -l -Pps
	% rm /tmp/dvi$$ps

Of course, these pathnames may not be right for your machine.

    See the files pspicture.tex and pspicture.latex (and tank.ps)
for examples of using PostScript in a TeX ddocument.
