		Gremlin  to  PostScript  Converter
		----------------------------------

     This program converts a gremlin file (produced by the original
version that runs on the AED displays or the newer version for the
Sun workstation) into a PostScript file which can be printed on
printers which support this page description language, such as the
Apple LaserWriter.

     The code in gr2ps.c was written by John Coker, and is copyrighted
by the Regents of the University of California.  Distribution and use of
this code is subject to licensing restrictions.

     The code in curve.c comes from the original Gremlin source and
was modified by Peehong Chen for this program.  This code is protected
by the Berkeley UNIX license agreement as well as the protections
for the author mentioned above.

     See the file PSinTeX for a description of how this software can
be used for PS illustrations in TeX documents and SCALING for a start
at semi-automatic placement of the figures.
