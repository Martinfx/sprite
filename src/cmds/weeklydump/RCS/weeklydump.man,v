.SH NAME
weeklydump \- Script to do weekly fully dumps
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBweeklydump\fR [\fB\-i\fR] [\fIstartFs\fR]
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fIstartFs\fR" 15
Start dumping with the named filesystem.
.IP "\-i" 15
Initialize the tape drives first with ``dump -s''.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script does full (level 0) dumps of all the filesystems that are
normally backed up.  It is normally invoked manually over the weekend.
.PP
The script has hard-coded a list of tape devices.  It
dumps filesystems onto the first tape until it gets an error.  It then
continues with the second tape until the next error, etc.  If it runs
out of tapes before all the filesystems have been dumped, it sends
mail to the user 
.B dumper
with the name of the first filesystem in the list that has yet to be
dumped.
.PP
The list of filesystems to dump is contained in
.BR /sprite/admin/dump/dumplist .
If
.B weeklydump
is invoked with the name of a filesystem, it starts with that
filesystem, skipping over the filesystems that appear before it in the
list.  If
.B weeklydump
is not given the name of a filesystem, it looks for the starting
filesystem in
.BR /sprite/admin/dump/doingweekly .
If that file is empty, 
.B weeklydump
simply starts at the top of the list.
.PP
.B Weeklydump
puts the name of the current user in
.BR /sprite/admin/dump/dumpalias .
Mail sent to the ``dumper'' alias is sent to the user named in this
file.  
.B Weeklydump
also creates the file
.BR /sprite/admin/dump/doingweekly ,
which disables the daily dumps.  This
file is removed when the weekly dumps complete.
.PP
If 
.B weeklydump
detects an error, it sends mail to
.B dumper
and exits.  It also creates a status file, so that if the machine
running the weekly dumps
crashes while the dumps are running, mail will be sent to
.B dumper
when the machine reboots, telling about the crash.
.PP
If
.B weeklydump
is invoked with the 
.B \-i 
flag, it will initialize the tapes in both tape
drives before starting.

.SH FILES
All the following files are in /sprite/admin/dump:
.IP doingweekly 15
lock file to prevent daily dump from running.  Names the filesystem
currently being dumped.
.IP doingweekly.active 15
status file used to detect crashes.  Contains the name of the host
running the dumps.
.IP dumpalias 15
User name of the current dumper, for error and status messages.
.IP dumpdates 15
list of filesystems dumped, at what time, what tape, etc.
.IP dumplist 15
list of file systems to dump.
.IP dumplog 15
very large status log from the dump programs
.IP tapelist 15
list of tape devices uses for the dump

.SH KEYWORDS
dump, tape, backup
