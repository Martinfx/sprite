.SH NAME
login \- Allow a user to login
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlogin\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIuser\fR]
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 15
Print a summary of the command-line options and exit without
performing any logins.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR"
Don't record information about the user in a file of logins.
The default is to record the login and logout in a file
of logins used by programs like \fBfinger\fR.
.IP "\fB\-P \fIportNum\fR"
Use \fIportNum\fR as the port number associated with this login in
the file of logins (ignored if the \fB\-l\fR option is given).
.IP "\fB\-r\f"
Repeat:  when a login shell exits, prompt for another account and
password, and start another login shell.  The default is for \fBlogin\fR
to exit as soon as its login shell exits.
.IP "\fB\-d \fIdevice\fR"
Use \fIdevice\fR for the login rather than the current tty.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
If an extra argument is given, \fBlogin\fR uses that name as the name
of the user to log in.  Otherwise, it prompts for an account name.  In
either case, \fBlogin\fR prompts for a password.  If the
password matches the account, the user is logged in and a command
shell is run for the user.  Information about the account, password,
home directory, and login shell is taken from \fB/etc/passwd\fR.  If
the password does not match the account, or the account doesn't exist,
\fBlogin\fR will prompt for a new account and password.  
.PP
If \fIdevice\fR is given, then \fBlogin\fR attempts to use it for the
standard input, standard output, and standard error channels
associated with the login.  If no \fIdevice\fR is given, then \fBlogin\fR
uses the standard I/O channels provided to it by the shell.
.PP
Normally, \fBlogin\fR waits for the login shell to exit, which signals
the end of the login session, and then \fBlogin\fR exits.  If, however,
the \fB\-r\fR switch is given, then \fBlogin\fR will repeat itself, asking
for another account and password, and running another login shell.
This will repeat indefinitely.  If the repeat switch is not given,
logins will time out after 60 seconds if they are not completed.
.PP
If the \fB\-l\fR switch isn't given, then \fBlogin\fR will record information
about the login and logout in a file for use by programs like Finger.
The \fB\-P\fR switch is used to indicate which of several ports to
associate with the login.  If \fB\-l\fR is given, then no login information
is recorded.
