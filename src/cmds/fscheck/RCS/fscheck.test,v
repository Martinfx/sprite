@The following is a list of the test cases that fscheck was run on. After each
error in the file system is the correction that fscheck made.

    1 allocated file descriptor marked free in descriptor bitmap
	bitmap corrected
    2 free file descriptor marked allocated in descriptor bitmap
	bitmap corrected
    3 allocated data block marked free in data block bitmap
	bitmap corrected
    4 free data block marked allocated in data block bitmap
	bitmap corrected
    5 file descriptor with invalid magic number
	descriptor marked free in bitmap
    6 file with incorrect link count
	link count set to value determined by traversing directory tree
    7 file with size < data blocks pointed to by descriptor
	size adjusted
    8 file with incorrect block count
	block count corrected
    9 directory with hole
	hole filled in with empty entries
    10 invalid index in indirect block
	hole created
    11 invalid direct block number
	hole created
    12 invalid indirect block number
	hole created
    13 fragment that is not last block in file
	block of data starting at fragment copied to another block
    14 part of a block shared with another file
	block copied
    15 direct block shared with another file
	block copied
    16 block 0 in something other than the root directory
	block copied
    17 doubly indirect block shared with another file
	block and all sub-blocks copied
    18 doubly indirect block shared, but block contains invalid index
	hole created
    19 unreferenced file
	added to lost+found
    20 unreferenced directory
	added to lost+found
    21 empty directory 
	changed to a file
    22 root directory marked free
	root reconstructed
    23 root directory is a file
	root reconstructed
    24 root fd zeroed and block 0 zeroed
	root reconstructed
    25 directory with invalid record length
	record length corrected

Notes:
    sharing was tested for both deleting and copying blocks

There are some configurations of files that are somewhat uncommon and may
pose a problem for fscheck. The following were tested to make sure fscheck
does not modify them.
    1 file with hole
    2 empty file
    3 file with size > data blocks


Fscheck has a number of command line options. The following were tested.
The following functionality of fscheck was tested
    1 initialize bad block file descriptor
    2 update host id
    3 output copied to file
    4 output copied to file on same partition (file empty)
    5 output copied to file on same partition (file not empty)
    6 change output buffer size
    7  heap size limited
