.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBrmold\fR program deletes all of the named files that haven't
been accessed in the last \fInumDays\fR days.  It prints the names
of all the files it deleted.  If the \fB-mod\fR switch is given,
then \fBrmold\fR deletes all the files that haven't been modified
in \fInumDays\fR days.  If \fB-print\fR is specified then \fBrmold\fR
prints the names of files that haven't been accessed (or modified)
in \fInumDays\fR, but it doesn't delete any of them.
.PP
If 
.B timesFrom
is specified, 
.B rmold
will use the access (or modify) time of the same-named file in the
given alternate directory.  This option lets you delete old backup files after
the installed version of the file has been around for awhile.  For
example, to delete backup copies of commands that were installed over
90 days ago, you could do something like
.DS
	cd /sprite/cmds.$MACHINE.old
	rmold -mod -timesFrom /sprite/cmds.$MACHINE 90 *
