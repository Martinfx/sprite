.SH NAME
initsprite \- First process executed during bootstrap
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBinitsprite\fR [\fB\-cfsx\fR] [\fB\-b\fR \fIbootcommand\fR] 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fIbootcommand\fR" 18
\fIBootcommand\fR will be passed to the prom if the machine is rebooted.
This happens if there is an error checking the root partition.
The \fIbootcommands\fR parameter allows the reboot to be done using the same
kernel and arguments as the original boot. 
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 18
Causes a fileserver to run \fBrootcmds\fR before running \fBdiskcmds\fR. 
\fBRootcmds\fR typically contains commands that allows a non-root fileserver
to serve as root. 
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 18
Causes a fileserver mount its disks without checking them.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 18
Causes \fBinitsprite\fR to exec a login instead of running \fBdiskcmds\fR 
and \fBbootcmds\fR.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR" 18
Causes a fileserver to run \fBrootcmds\fR before running \fBdiskcmds\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBInitsprite\fR is the first user-level program executed when
Sprite bootstraps itself on a machine.  It is invoked as root,
with no arguments.  \fBInitsprite\fR opens the console terminal
on its standard I/O channels, initializes environment variables
like \fBHOST\fR, \fBMACHINE\fR, and \fBPATH\fR, and then invokes
\fBcsh\fR command scripts to perform system initialization.
.PP
\fBInitsprite\fR looks first for a file \fB/boot/cmds/csh\fR;
if it exists, then it is invoked to process the 
command script in \fB/boot/diskcmds\fR.  The purpose of \fBdiskcmds\fR
is to initialize a local disk, if there is one (if there is a local disk
the kernel will load the prefix for \fB/bootTmp\fR and \fB/\fR before invoking
\fBinitsprite\fR).
.PP
The main initialization script is in the file \fB/boot/bootcmds\fR.
However, if it is desirable to perform special initialization
operations for a particular machine, then there should exist a
file \fB/hosts/\fImachine\fB/bootcmds\fR where \fImachine\fR
is the name of the machine to be treated specially;  \fBinitsprite\fR
checks for this file and executes it in preference to \fB/boot/bootcmds\fR.
Typically, the machine-dependent script will source \fB/boot/bootcmds\fR
and then perform machine-specific initialization afterwards.
.PP
If \fBinitsprite\fR successfully executes \fB/boot/bootcmds\fR (or a
machine-specific replacement), then it exits.  Otherwise it
invokes an interactive shell as root on the console device.
Normally \fBbootcmds\fR takes care of starting up \fBlogin\fR
processes.
.PP
For more information see the man page for \fBboot\fR.
