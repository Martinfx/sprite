.SH NAME
migcmd \- Print or update information relating to process migration
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmigcmd\fR [\fB\-sSZptT\fR] [\fB\-[IE] (none|all|root)\fR] [\fB\-[il] (0|1)\fR] [\fB\-l (0|1)\fR] [\fB\-P \fInumRecs\fR] [\fB\-d \fIdebugLevel\fR] [\fB\-V \fImigrationVersion\fR] 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 20
A message is printed to indicate the status of process migration on the 
current host, including the migration level and the conditions under
which migration is permitted.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 20
Migration statistics are printed.  These include such values as the
average time to migrate an active process, the average time to perform
a remote exec, and the total number of migrations, evictions, and
remote execs performed.
.IP "\fB\-Z\fR" 20
The kernel migrations statistics are reset to 0.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR" 20
Change the import restrictions for process migration.  (The caller must be root.)
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 20
Change the export restrictions for process migration.  (The caller must be root.)
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 20
Change whether idle time is considered when determining the availability of 
this host.  (The caller must be root.)
.IP "\fB\-l\fR" 20
Change whether load average is considered when determining the availability of 
this host.  (The caller must be root.)
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 20
Process migration trace records are printed.  The number of records
may be altered by the \fB\-P\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-P \fInumRecs\fR" 20
The number of trace records to print is modified to be \fInumRecs\fR.  This
option must be used with the \fB\-p\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 20
Process migration tracing is enabled for the current host.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR" 20
Process migration tracing is disabled for the current host.
.IP "\fB\-d \fIdebugLevel\fR" 20
The kernel process migration debug level is set to \fIdebugLevel\fR.
.IP "\fB\-V \fImigrationVersion\fR" 20
The kernel process migration version is set to \fImigrationVersion\fR.
The caller must be root.

.SH INTRODUCTION
.LP
This command is used to perform functions related to process migration.
\fBMigcmd\fR  is normally used to print the status of process migration 
availability or migration statistics.  \fBMigcmd\fR may also be used
to restrict which users may export or import processes from or to 
the local host (the caller must be root to do so); change whether load
average and/or idle time are considered when deciding whether the
current host is available for imports;
print process
migration trace  records; enable or disable tracing of process
migration activity; or set the kernel's migration ``debugging level''
or ``migration version''.
.SH "MIGRATION STATE"
.LP
\fBMigcmd\fR prints the status of process migration
availability if the \fB\-s\fR flag is specified.
As root, one may modify the restrictions on process migration.  For
both exporting and importing processes, root may choose to restrict
migration to processes owned by root, or not allow migration at all,
or allow all users to migrate.  These options are specified to the
\fB\-E\fR and \fB\-I\fR flags as \fBroot\fR, \fBnone\fR, and \fBall\fR
respectively.  In addition, root is permitted to instruct the
\fBloadavg\fR daemon whether to consider idle time and/or load average
when announcing the availability of the host for importation.  These
options are \fB\-i\fR and \fB\-l\fR, respectively, and take an integer
argument: \fB1\fR specifies that the criterion should be ignored, and
\fB0\fR specifies that it should be considered.
.SH "STATISTICS"
.LP
The \fB-S\fR flag causes \fBMigcmd\fR  to print statistics on its
standard output.  These statistics change too rapidly to list the
format here.  The format is (hopefully) self-explanatory.
.SH "TRACING"
.LP
The \fB\-p\fR flag may be used to dump process migration trace records.
The maximum number of records defaults to 200 but may be modified with
the \fB\-P\fR option.  By default, tracing is disabled and no trace
records will be printed.  To enable tracing, one may specify the
\fB\-t\fR flag, and to disable it, one may specify the \fB\-T\fR flag.  
.SH "MIGRATION DEBUG LEVEL"
.LP
The kernel's debug level may be modified using the \fB\-d\fR  option.
Subsequently higher values for the debug level will cause more
debugging statements 
to be executed. For example, to have no migration debugging enabled
whatsoever, the level may be set to 0.  To enable error messages that
indicate unusual but non-fatal events, the level may be 2 (this is the
current default).  To enable more messages about the internal
operation of migration within the kernel, such as forwarded system
calls, the level may be set to values from 3-10.  ``Less interesting''
events are conditioned on higher values of the debug level.
.SH "MIGRATION VERSION"
.LP
The kernel's migration version may be modified by root using the
\fB\-V\fR  option.  This should be done only when the kernel is
compiled with an incorrect version for some reason, in order to cause
the kernel to be compatible vis-a-vis migration with a different class
of kernels.
