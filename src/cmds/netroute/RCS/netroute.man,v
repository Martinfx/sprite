.SH INTRODUCTION
.LP
This command is used to access the kernel's internal route table.
This route table is used to determine routes for sending RPC packets
between the hosts. The route table has nothing to do with user-level
network communication via TCP/IP or similar protocols.
Normally \fBnetroute\fR is invoked during the boot script to install routes
to all the hosts found in \fC/etc/spritehosts\fR 
(\fC/etc/spritehosts.new\fR during the transition period to the new 
spritehosts file format). 
The \fC/etc/spritehosts\fR file 
contains the spriteID of the host,
a network type and address (i.e. ethernet),
an internet address,
a machine type,
and a name plus optional aliases.
The spriteID is used internally for RPC communication between Sprite hosts.
The network type and network address are used to map the Sprite ID
to the correct local network address.  The internet address is used
for the internet protocols.  The machine type is used when expanding
the string ``$MACHINE'' inside pathnames.  The file server must know
its clients machine types in order to do this correctly.  The names
are used to make console error messages contain a human understandable
host name, and are also used with the internet library routines.
.SH USAGE
.LP
There are three operations that can be performed on routes.  One
is to print them, another is to install them, and the last is to
delete them.
These operations are specified with the \fBp\fR,
\fBi\fR and \fBd\fR options.

.SH INSTALLING ROUTES
.LP
For installing hosts, the information is normally taken from a
host database file.  A host can be installed from scratch by specifying
its name (\fBh\R option), machine type (\fBm\R option), and
network addresses.  The network addresses are specified using
the \fBether\R, \fBultra\fR, and \fBfddi\fR options.  The strings
passed to these options must be of the form \fInet_address@@inet_address\fR
because each network interface has both a network address and
an internet address.  At least one must be specified.
.LP
Routes to hosts can be installed only over one network type.  When
they are installed, \fBnetroute\fR uses a list of types to check
in a predefined order (use the \fBv\fR option to find this order.)
It will try to establish a route using the first network type;
if that fails, it will try the next, etc.  This list can be changed
dynamically using the \fBfavor\fR and \fBdisfavor\fR options to
either favor one network type most or one network type the least,
respectively.  Both options can be used at the same time.
.LP
For example, normally routes are installed over ethernet.  
To change it so that fddi routes are installed where possible,
use:
.sp
% netroute -i -favor fddi
.sp
This will install fddi routes to those machines that support fddi
routes, and ethernet routes to the remainder.
.LP
When new routes are installed successfully, the previous route is
removed.

.SH DELETING ROUTES

.LP
Routes are deleted by specifying a route ID using the
\fBd\fR option.

.SH PRINTING ROUTES
.LP
When routes are printed, the following information is given about
each route: the Sprite ID of the host to which the route goes;
the hostname and the machine type of that host; a description of
the route from the kernel; the route ID, and the route ID shifted
by right by 16 places; the network type of the route;  the
network address of the interface from which the route sends
packets;  the protocol that the route serves;
the route flags; a reference count to the route; min and max
packet sizes over the route; min and max RPC sizes over the route;
and the network address of the destination host to which packets
are sent.

Define the net type of the route for the host specified by -h option. 
(Must be \fBether\fR or \fRinet\fR)
.IP "\fB\-s\fR"
Set the internet address used by this host.

This command is used to set the kernel's internal route table.
Normally this is invoked during the boot script with a -f argument
that specifies a file from which to get the information.  The standard
file is \fB/etc/spritehosts\fR, and it contains the spriteID of the host,
d66 59
a124 9
If the \fB-p\fR option is specified the kernel routing tables are printed
and no routes are altered. 
The \fB-s\fR option instructs netroute to initialized the kernel idea of 
this hosts interaddress.  The interaddress is taken from the host 
database but may be overridden with the \fB-i\fR option.
The \fB-t\fR, \fB-e\fR, \fB-i\fR, \fB-m\fR, and \fB-n\fR options are used to 
override the defaults in the host database. If the host specified with the
\fB-h\fR option is not present in the database 
the \fB-e\fR, \fB-i\fR, and \fB-m\fR and \fB-n\fR option must be present.
