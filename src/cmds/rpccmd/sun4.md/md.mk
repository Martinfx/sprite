#
# Prototype Makefile for machine-dependent directories.
#
# A file of this form resides in each ".md" subdirectory of a
# command.  Its name is typically "md.mk".  During makes in the
# parent directory, this file (or a similar file in a sibling
# subdirectory) is included to define machine-specific things
# such as additional source and object files.
#
# This Makefile is automatically generated.
# DO NOT EDIT IT OR YOU MAY LOSE YOUR CHANGES.
#
# Generated from /sprite/lib/mkmf/Makefile.md
