.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-from\ fromDevice\fP
Read the label from this device.
.IP \fB\-w\fP
Write a new label.
.IP \fB\-q\fP
Write a new label quickly, without prompting for partition information.
.IP \fB\-sun\fP
Write out a Sun label.  The default is to write whatever type of label was
read.
.IP \fB\-dec\fP
Write out a Dec label.
.IP \fB\-new\fP
Ignore any old label.
.IP \fIdevice\fP
The device file with the disk label.  Without \fB-from\fP it is the
device that the label is read from and written to, otherwise it is
the device that is written to.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This reads the disk label and verifies its checksum.  If the
\fB-from fromDevice\fP option is present then the disk label is
read from the \fBfromDevice\fP, and the \fBdevice\fP argument
becomes the device to which the label is written to.
.LP
If the \fB\-w\fP
option is present labeldisk interactively prompts for partition information.
After this the user is presented with the new label and given
the opportunity to commit the change or abort it.  The user is also
given the chance to write the label to all of the valid partitions
found on the device.  ``valid'' means that the partition has a positive
number of cylinders associated with it, and that a file system
exists on the partition.  If a partition on the
disk is not ``valid'', then it is skipped.  An attempt is made to
write the label to the raw disk in the improbable case that no
valid partition starts on cylinder 0.  If labeldisk was not
able to write the label to the raw disk or to a partition that
begins at cylinder 0, then a warning is issued to that effect.
.LP
The \fB-q\fP option turns off the prompting for partition information
only.  This is useful for copying a label from one partition
on one device to other partitions on the same or different device
if the user knows that the label on the from device has the
correct information.  Overrides the \fB-w\fP option.
.LP
The \fB-dec\fP option converts the label being written to a dec label.
.LP
The \fB-sun\fP option converts the label being written to a dec label.
.LP
The \fB-new\fP option ignores any label read, and creates a new one
instead.  If either the \fB-dec\fP or the \fB-sun\fP option is specified
then the new label created is of the specified type.
.LP
Each disk is divided into 8 partitions, named ``ai'' thru ``gi''.
Each partition is specified with a starting cylinder number and the
number of cylinders it contains.  Unused partitions
are indicated with a zero size.  Partitions can overlap, but
overlapping partitions should never be used simultaneously!
Traditionally partition ``ai'' is a small partition suitable for the root
or a small /tmp.  Partition ``bi'' is a slightly larger system
suitable for a single machine's swap directory.
Partition ``ci'' is a single large partition that specifies the whole disk.
Partitions ``di'' and ``ei'' are often used as large partitions
beyond ``ai'' and ``bi''.
Partition ``gi'' is usually set up as all the space after ``ai'' and ``bi''.
Partitions ``fi'' and ``hi'' usually aren't used, but they can be.
.LP
Partitions are useful to quarantine different sets of users from
one another, although they are a pain to change once a filesystem
has been created on them.  Changing them requires recreating any affected
filesystems.
