	changes in version.c, but to use ChangeLog instead.

	* version.c (version_string): Put "GNU" in all-caps.

	* version.c: Moved all comments about changes to ChangeLog (this file).
	Many anonymous entries have been attributed to Jay Fenlason (hack).

Thu Aug 17 15:53:57 1989  Jay Fenlason  (hack at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	large frags (larger than frags.chunk_size).

Thu Aug  3 14:44:24 1989  Jay Fenlason  (hack at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

Wed Aug 2 12:55:?? 1989  Jay Fenlason (hack at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* sparc.c (comment_chars[]): Removed '|' because it was causing
	problems.  Probably not the best fix, since I suspect other
	assemblers (68020) may get | in .stabs also, and the 68020 needs
	the '|' comment character.

	* ns32k.c (convert_iif): Moved size_so_far+=size and size=0 inside
	 the check for a valid type.

	* sparc-opcode.h: Modified the entries for std "q,[1+i]", "D,[1+i]",

	  There was a bug when using %ebp as a base register with no
	  displacement

	  Instructions like andb $0xffffff, %al used to put out too many
	  immediate bytes

	  The splitting jump instructions across frags could happen when
	  obstack_room()==6 too.
