This program requires a modification to the ipServer to allow
raw_protocol sockets to send ip packets including ip headers and to
receive ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED messages.  The modified ipServer can
be compiled using "pmake XCFLAGS=-DREAL_RAW" in the ipServer
source directory. This ipServer mod will break all other programs using
RAW sockets (such as ping)!!!
