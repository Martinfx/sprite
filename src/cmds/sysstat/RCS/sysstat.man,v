.SH NAME
sysstat \- print statistics and information about the state of the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsysstat \fR[\fB\-vcR\fR]
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 14
Print out the compilation version timestamp for the kernel.  This is
the default if no options are specified. 
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 14
Print out the number of times each system call has been invoked.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fIn\fR" 14
Enable or disable system call timing.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 14
For each system call, print the number of calls and how much time was
required. 
.IP "\fB\-R\fR" 14
Reset the count and time information for system calls.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This command prints out statistics and other information about the
system.   
.SH "VERSION TIMESTAMP"
.IP "\fB\-v\fR"
By default, \fBsysstat\fR prints the compilation version timestamp for the
kernel.  This is a unique identifier indicating who compiled the
kernel and when.  This information is printed if no options are
specified, or if the \fI-v\fR  option is specified.  
.SH "SYSTEM CALL STATISTICS"
.IP "\fB\-c\fR"
This option indicates that \fBsysstat\fR should display a count of the
number of times each system call has been invoked.  For each call, the
number of invocations is printed along with an indication of whether
the call, if done by a migrated process, would be handled locally or
would require action by the process's \fIhome node\fR.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR"
This option tells 
.B sysstat
to display for each system call the number of times the call was
invoked, the total time spent in that call, and the average time spent
in that call.  Note that if a process is migrated, its system calls
are recorded by the host that it is executing on, rather than by the
home node.  Normally system call timing is turned off; use the
.B \-p 
option to turn it on.
.IP "\fB\-R\fR"
This option causes \fBsysstat\fR reset the kernel's count of the
number of times each system call has been invoked, as well as the
accumulated time for each system call.  Thus, subsequent invocations of
\fBsysstat\fR with the \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-t\fR option will report only
activity since the invocation with the \fB-R\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR"
This option controls whether Sprite keeps track of how much time each
system call takes.  To turn on system call timing, use 
.BR "\-p 1" ;
to turn it off, use
.BR "\-p 0" .
.SH BUGS
System call timing is only available on ds5000s.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH KEYWORDS

This option causes \fBsysstat\fR to perform a system call to reset the
kernel's count of the number of times each system call has been
invoked.  Subsequent invocations of \fBsysstat\fR with the \fI-c\fR  option
will report the count of calls since the invocation with the \fI-R\fR option.
