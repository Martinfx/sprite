 *
 * Fs_Read --
 *
 *      The "normal" Fs_Read routine for user code.  Read from the file
 *      indicated by the stream id into the buffer.  bufSize indicates how
 *      much data to read, and amountReadPtr is an output parameter that
 *      indicates how much data were read.  A length of zero means
 *      end-of-file.
 *
 *      If Fs_ReadStub blocks to wait for data on the stream and a signal
 *      is received by the process during the wait, then the system call
 *      is aborted in order to process the signal.  When the signal has
 *      been processed, the system call will return with a
 *      GEN_ABORTED_BY_SIGNAL result, and *readCountPtr will have been
 *      updated to reflect the number of bytes read so far.  This routine
 *      will detect this condition and restart the system call to read the
 *      remainder of the data.
 *
 * Results:
 *	An error code.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	The read access pointer for the stream is advanced by
 *	the amount of data read.
 *
