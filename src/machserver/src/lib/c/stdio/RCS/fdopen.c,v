 * fdopen --
 *
 *	This procedure initializes a FILE structure for a file (or pipe
 *	or similar OS-supplied thing) that has been opened or inherited
 *	through some other mechanism.
 *
 * Results:
 *	The return value may be used to perform buffered I/O on
 *	streamID.  If streamID isn't valid, then NULL is returned.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	The internal list stdioFileStreams gets a new element.
 *
 * Implementation Warning:
 *	To be compatible with BSD, this procedure must permit multiple
 *	streams on the same file stream!  This seems like a very bad
 *	idea for a seekable stream, but seems to get used for network
 *	connection.
