 * MemData.c --
 *
 *	Contains variables that are shared among the various memory
 *	allocation procedures.  They need to be in a separate file
 *	in order to avoid unpleasant interactions with some old-
 *	fashioned UNIX programs that define some or all of the malloc-
 *	related stuff for themselves.  If the variables are tied to
 *	a particular procedure, then the procedure will get linked in
 *	whenever the variables are needed, even in the program has
 *	defined its own version of that procedure.
