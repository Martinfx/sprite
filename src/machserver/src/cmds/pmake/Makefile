# Prototype Makefile for the topmost directory of a command that is
# divided into multiple subdirectories.  When makes are invoked here,
# this Makefile arranges for most of them to be passed on to each
# of its subdirectories.
#
# This Makefile is automatically generated.
# DO NOT EDIT IT OR YOU MAY LOSE YOUR CHANGES.
