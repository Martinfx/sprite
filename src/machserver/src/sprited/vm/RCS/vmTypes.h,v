/* 
 * The segment is the basic VM abstraction.  It corresponds to a 
 * native Sprite segment and under Mach is known as a memory object.
 * It backs some region of memory with a file, called a swap file.
 * There is a one-to-one correspondence between swap files and
 * segments: that is, there is at most one segment for a swap file in
 * the system.  Normally the swapFilePtr is used to refer to the swap file. 
 * The swapFileHandle is used if the swap file has been closed (e.g., for 
 * sticky segments).  It is a ClientData for historical reasons.
 * 
 * There is also an "initialization file", which is used to supply pages if
 * the swap file doesn't have them.  See the notes for Vm_SegmentType for
 * the relation ship between the files and the segment type.
 * 
 * The control port is used for making lock requests.  It is also used 
 * as a unique ID to handle races between memory object creation and 
 * destruction.  If it is non-null, it means that the kernel is aware 
 * of the segment and the segment should not be destroyed.
 * 
 * For some segment types, the size of the segment may be larger than
 * the size of the backing file.  This can happen if someone has
 * mapped the segment read-write and specified a longer length.  The
 * file will be lengthened, using zero-fill pages, as necessary.  The
 * segment size recorded here is in bytes and is always equal to some
 * integer number of pages.  
 * 
 * The swap file size is obtained from the file service when the segment is 
 * created and is thereafter maintained by the VM code.  There are two 
 * reasons for doing this: (1) performance (avoid an RPC to the server for 
 * every page read), and (2) correctness (I have seen a bug where 
 * Fs_GetAttrStream would return a size of 0 for a 32MB file).  The 
 * drawback of this scheme is that it destroys any chance of maintaining 
 * consistency for mapped files, but then Sprite never supported that 
 * anyway.
 * 
 * Note: once the files for a segment are set, they shouldn't be 
 * changed.  This lets us use the files while the segment is 
 * unlocked.
 *
 * Requests for a segment are put on a per-segment queue, so as not to have 
 * a permanent thread for each segment, and to avoid tying up other
 * segments if one segment gets stuck.  When a request is dequeued, the
 * request buffer comes first, followed by the reply buffer.

/* 
 * The Vm_TaskInfo defines VM-related information for each task.  
 * Currently we just keep a list of each segment that is mapped into
 * the task, along with the range of addresses that the segment might
 * back.  The segment list has two purposes.  First, when we clear out
 * a process's address space, we're more likely to manage the segments'
 * reference counts correctly.  Second, it lets us determine when to 
 * grow the process's stack.  Because we expect to need the code, 
 * heap, and stack segments fairly frequently, we keep a distinguised 
 * set of pointers for those segments.  XXX The stack segment should 
 * be per-process, not per-task.
 * 
 * Note that we don't keep track of the exact mappings for a segment.  
 * For example, if a process maps a segment then later unmaps a 
 * portion of it, we'll still think it has the entire segment mapped.  
 * This has three potential problems:
 * 
 * (1) when clearing a process's address space (at exec), we might try 
 * to deallocate memory that's not allocated.  Since we're already 
 * planning to just deallocate the entire range in one shot, this 
 * shouldn't be a problem.  
 * 
 * (2) we might hold onto resources longer than necessary.  For
 * example, if a user program deallocates a mapped file without
 * notifying us, the reference for the segment won't go away until the
 * process dies or does an exec.  Hopefully this won't be much of a
 * problem in practice.  If it is, one solution might be to mark the 
 * segment in memory_object_terminate, and have a background process 
 * run through the process table looking for such marked segments.
 * 
 * (3) we might fail to extend the stack correctly.  This could happen 
 * if a segment is mapped at a high address, near the stack, and then 
 * later freed without notifying us.  If the stack then tries to
 * extend into memory formerly occupied by this mapped segment, we 
 * will refuse to extend the stack and generate an incorrect 
 * exception.  This should not be a problem in practice.  If it is, 
 * one solution would be to query the kernel for the current 
 * allocations in the faulting task and use that information, rather 
 * than the list of mapped segments, to decide whether to extend the 
 * stack.

 * native Sprite segment and under Mach is known as a memory object.  
 * It backs some region of memory with a file.  There is a one-to-one
 * correspondence between files and segments: there is at most one 
 * segment for any file in the system, and the offset in a segment is 
 * the same as the offset in the backing file.

 * The size of the segment may be larger than the size of the 
 * backing file.  This can happen if someone has mapped the segment 
 * read-write and specified a longer length.  The file will be 
 * lengthened, using zero-fill pages, as necessary.  The size recorded 
 * here is in bytes and is always equal to some integer number of 
 * pages.

 * The Vm_TaskInfo defines VM-related information for each task.  We 
 * keep a list of each segment that is mapped into the task, with its 
 * starting address and how long it is.  This is so that when we clear 
 * out a process's address space, we're more likely to manage the 
 * segment reference count correctly.
 * 
 * XXX If the client maps a file, deallocates the mapping, the maps
 * something else, the list of mapped files could contain multiple
 * files that are shown as mapped to the same start address.  This can
 * cause two problems: (1) the Sprite server might try to deallocate a
 * segment after it's already been deallocated; (2) the list might
 * hold resources (i.e., memory for the VmMappedSegment struct) that 
 * are no longer needed.
 * 
 * Problem (1) can be dealt with in one of two ways: (a) when adding 
 * an element to the per-process list of segments, invalidate (and 
 * remove) elements that have conflicting mappings; (b) when 
 * deallocating memory, ignore KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS errors.
 * 
 * Problem (2) can be partially fixed by requesting a no-senders
 * notification when a segment is no longer in use.  It can not be
 * totally avoided because the server won't get notified if additional 
 * processes keep their mapping of the file.
