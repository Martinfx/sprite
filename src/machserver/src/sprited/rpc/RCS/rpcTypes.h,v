 * A client stub procedure has to set up 2 sets of 2 storage areas for an
 * RPC.  The first pair of storage areas is for the request, or input,
 * parameters of the service procedure.  The second pair is for the reply,
 * or return, parameters of the service procedure.  Both the request and
 * the reply have a "data" area and a "parameter" area.  The general
 * convention is that the parameter area is meant for flags, tokens, and
 * other small control information.  The data area is for larger chunks of
 * data like pathnames or fileblocks. Either, or both, of the areas can
 * be empty by setting the address to NIL and the size to zero.
 *
 * The function of a client stub is to arrange its input parameters into
 * two buffers for the two parts of the request.  Also, it must set up the
 * buffer space for the two parts of the reply.  The RPC system will copy
 * the reply data and parameters into these areas, and the stub can access
 * them after Rpc_Call returns.
