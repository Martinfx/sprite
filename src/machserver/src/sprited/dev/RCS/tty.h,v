 * For each terminal or terminal-like device supported by the kernel,
 * there exists a record with the following structure.  The structure
 * (and the code in devTty.c) is complicated in native Sprite by the fact 
 * that the Td library calls malloc, which means that some of its
 * procedures can't be invoked by interrupt handlers (or with interrupts
 * disabled).  To get around this problem, devTty.c introduces an extra
 * level of buffering between the interrupt handler and Td.  The Td
 * structures are locked using a sleep lock, and are ONLY accessed from
 * process level.  The extra buffers are handled without locks by using
 * pointers carefully.  Transfers between the Td buffers and the DevTty
 * buffers are made only by procedures running at process level.
 * 
 * None of this hair is probably necessary for the Sprite server, but it's 
 * probably not worth taking out right now.
