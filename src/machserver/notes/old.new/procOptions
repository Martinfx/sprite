server thread context:

(1) all point to single PCB for Sprite
- don't have info in proc table for all server threads, don't have
  much debugging info

(2) nil

(3) point to per-thread full PCB
- lots of unused fields in PCB
o need back pointer in the PCB to thread

(4) point to per-thread "server" PCB
- have to be careful about accessing the union type correctly
o need back pointer in the PCB to thread
