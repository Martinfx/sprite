ifdefs for various disabled Sprite features:

SPRITED_ACCOUNTING: keeping track of per-process CPU usage, etc.

SPRITED_DEVICES: general support for access to devices.  Also used in
libc sources.

SPRITED_DEVNET: support for the "network device" (e.g., for IP server).

SPRITED_DEVTIMER: support for /dev/timer.

SPRITED_FLOAT: real floating-point support (e.g., for MIPS).  Also
used in test programs and maybe libc.

SPRITED_GRAPHICS: support for X, local frame buffer, graphics
operations, etc.

SPRITED_L1_COMMANDS: support for L1 debugging from the console.

SPRITED_LOCALDISK: support for direct access to local disks.

SPRITED_LOCALTAPE: support for access to local tape.

SPRITED_MIGRATION: support for process migration.

SPRITED_NATIVE_MALLOC: support for the binned malloc used by native
Sprite.

SPRITED_PROFILING: support for profiling user processes.

SPRITED_REALFS: Sprite remote file system

SPRITED_SETTIME: Enables setting the time-of-day clock from the time
that the RPC startup code gets.  Should this get ripped out permanently?

SPRITED_SIGNALS: support for sending, catching signals.  Also used
within libc.

SPRITED_STICKY_SEGMENTS: support for caching unused text segments.

SPRITED_SYSLOG: support for /dev/syslog.

SPRITED_TIMER: user process interval timers.

SPRITED_REMOTE_DEBUG: support for remote debugging of the server (dbg
module, etc.).

SPRITED_UNIX_COMPAT: Unix binary compatibility support.

SPRITED_USERDEBUG: support for suspending, resuming, debugging user
processes.

SPRITED_USERPRIORITY: support for user "Proc_SetPriority" calls.

SPRITED_VAR_FS_CACHE: support for the variable-size FS cache.

LIBC_MALLOC: malloc support for client programs (in C library)

LIBC_PRINTF: stdio support for client programs (used in C library)

LIBC_TCP: support for TCP/IP protocols, BSD user programs that use them.

LIBC_USECONSOLE: stdio routines can access /dev/console.  Also used in
test code.

LIBC_USERLOCK: support for user-level monitor locks & condition
variables (in C library).
