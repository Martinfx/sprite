Once we have the "proof-of-concept" version, here are some other
things to think about:

- rewrite pageout code to cooperate with file system? (movable
  boundary between FS and VM pages) 

- Replace Mach drivers with Sprite drivers.  (May want to do this
  earlier, at least to provide RAID & Ultranet support.) 

- Replace AT&T-licensed libc code with equivalent Sprite libc code.
  (Also replace non-licensed code for which the Sprite version is
  cleaner or more powerful?)
