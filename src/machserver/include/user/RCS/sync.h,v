 * Monitor Locks --
 *
 *	The following set of macros are used to emulate monitored
 *	procedures of Mesa.  The Sprite style document has a complete
 *	description of the conventions required to emulate a set
 *	of monitored procedures; a summary is presented here.
 *
 *      The LOCK_MONITOR and UNLOCK_MONITOR macros depend on a constant
 *      LOCKPTR.  LOCKPTR should be defined as the address of the lock
 *      variable used to lock the monitor.  Something like the following
 *      two lines of code should appear at the beginning of a file of
 *      monitored procedures.
 *
 *	Sync_Lock modMonitorLock;
 *	#define LOCKPTR (&modMonitorLock)
 *
 *	The pseudo-keywords INTERNAL and ENTRY denote internal and entry
 *	procedures of a monitor.  INTERNAL procedures can only be called
 *	when the monitor lock is held.  ENTRY procedures are procedures
 *	that acquire the lock.  There may also be External procedures.
 *	They are the default and there is no special keyword.  An External
 *	procedure doesn't explicitly acquire the monitor lock, but may
 *	call an ENTRY procedure.

 * on the condition. The monitor lock is reacquired after the process 
 * has been woken up.
 *
 * The address of the condition variable is used as the generic 'event'
 * that the process blocks on.  The value of the condition variable is
