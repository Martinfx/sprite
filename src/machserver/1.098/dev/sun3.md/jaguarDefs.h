 *	Declarations of data structures and constants for the Interphase
 *	V/SCSI 4210 Jaguar SCSI host bus adapter (HBA). This definitions 
 *	in this file come from the "V/SCSI 4210 Jaguar System Interface
 *	User's Guide", document number UG-0770-000-X0F. The document was
 *	obtained from:
 *		Interphase Corporation
 *		Application Engineering Department
 *		2925 Merrell Road
 *		Dallas, Tx 75229
 *
 * Note that this file should only contain information for the Jaguar 
 * HBA as a generic VME bus device.  This means that information about 
 * the Jaguar's interface to particle machines should not be included.
 *
 * The structures in this file are set up so that most C compilers will generate
 * layouts of the structures that match the Jaguar vision of the data 
 * structures. These structures should only need to be changed if the
 * Jaguar firmware changes.

 * communicate with the Jaguar, the host builds command blocks in the

 * declarations defined the memory image of these command blocks. The
 * acronyms (ie MCSB, MCE, etc) are taken from the Jaguar User's guide
 * mentioned above. The referend page numbers are also from this guide.
 *
