 * scsiDevice.h --
 *
 *	Declarations of Sprite interface to SCSI devices.  
 *	This file defines the interface to SCSI devices which consists 
 *	of three operations: Attach the device, Release the device, and
 *	send a SCSI command block to the device. 
 *
 *	INTERFACE SUMMARY: 
 *
 *	To interface to a SCSI device, the SCSI command formatter must first
 *	attach the device.  This is done by calling DevScsiAttachDevice() with
 *	the Fs_Device structure for the device. DevScsiAttachDevice 
 *	returns a ScsiDeviceHandle that contains the queue to insert 
 *	scsi command blocks for the device. The handle also 
 *	contains the procedure to call to release the device.
 *
