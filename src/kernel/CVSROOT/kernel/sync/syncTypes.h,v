 * syncTypes.h --
 *
 * 	Definitions of types for the synchronization module.
 * 	The synchronization module provides locks and condition
 * 	variables to other modules, plus a low level binary semaphore 
 *	needed to synchronize with interrupt handlers.
 *
 *	The behavior of the sync module can be modified using compiler 
 *	variables. These variables will change the structure of locks and
 *	how the locks are used. In general it is not a good idea to link
 *	modules that have been compiled with different versions of locks.
 *	
 *	    <default> -	 semaphores and locks have fields that contain a
 *		 	 character string name, the pc where the lock was
 *			 last locked, and a pointer to the pcb of the last
 *			 lock holder. The locking operation is slower because
 *			 these fields must be updated.
 *
 *	    CLEAN_LOCK - locks do not contain any extra fields. This version
 *		         of locks is intended for benchmarking the kernel.
 *	
 *	    LOCKREG    - locks are registered so that the information stored
 *			 in them can be retrieved. In addition to the fields
 *			 in the default version of locks, a count of hits
 *			 and misses on each lock is kept. Lock registration
 *			 must be done when the lock is created and destroyed.
 *			 The locking operation is slower due to the hit/miss
 *			 counters.  A count is kept for each spin lock that
 *			 records the number of times a processor spun waiting
 *			 for the lock.
 *
 *	    LOCKDEP    - Each lock keeps a list of locks that were held when
 *			 it was locked in addition to the information kept
 *			 in the LOCKREG version. Locks compiled with LOCKDEP
 *		         will get very large. This information can be used to 
 *			 construct a graph of the locking behavior of the
 *			 kernel. Locking and unlocking is slowed down due
 *			 to the necessity of recording previously held lock.
