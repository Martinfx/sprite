.SH NAME
arpd \- Respond to ARP and RARP requests
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBarpd\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-f \fIfileName\fR" 15
Use \fIfileName\fR as the configuration file containing host network
addresses.  The file \fB/etc/spritehosts\fR is used by default.  If
this switch is given, \fIfileName\fR must have the same format as
\fB/etc/spritehosts\fR.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 15
Verbose:  print information on standard output as requests are
processed.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 15
Print a summary of the command-line options and exit immediately.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBArpd\fR is a program that responds to requests made under the
Internet Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Reverse Address
Resolution Protocol (RARP).  See RFC826 for details on ARP and
RFC903 for details on RARP.  \fBArpd\fR reads a configuration
file (normally \fB/etc/spritehosts\fR) that describes a set of
hosts and their Internet and Ethernet addresses;  it will respond
to ARP and RARP requests for any
host listed in the file.  Note that this differs from the common
practice in many UNIX systems, where each host responds to ARP
requests for itself;  the norm in Sprite is for a single \fBarpd\fR
process to handle all requests for the Sprite network.
.PP
Although \fBarpd\fR caches the host information in its memory, it
checks the last-modified time on the configuration file before responding
to each request, and reloads its internal database if the configuration
file has changed.
.PP
\fBArpd\fR generates diagnostic messages on its standard output.
Normally, only major errors result in output, but if the \fB\-v\fR
switch is given, then additional output is generated to describe
all of the program's actions.
