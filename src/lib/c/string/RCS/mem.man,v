.SH NAME
memchr, memcmp, memcpy, memset \- Operations on byte arrays
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <string.h>

\fBchar *
\fBmemchr(\fIs\fB, \fIc\fB, \fIn\fB)

\fBint
\fBmemcmp(\fIs\fB, \fIs2\fB, \fIn\fB)

\fBchar *
\fBmemcpy(\fIdest\fB, \fIsource\fB, \fIn\fB)

\fBchar *
\fBmemset(\fIdest\fB, \fIc\fB, \fIn\fB)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS char source
.AP char *s in
Pointer to array of characters.
.AP char *source in
Pointer to array of characters to copy.
.AP char *dest out
Pointer to array of characters to modify.
.AP int c in
Value to search for (\fBmemchr\fR), or value to set to (\fBmemset\fR).
.AP int n in
Count of number of characters to test, copy, or set.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
These procedures manipulate memory as counted arrays of bytes.
.PP
The \fBmemchr\fR procedure searches for the first occurrence of \fIc\fR
in the \fIn\fR bytes starting at \fIs\fR, and returns the address of the
first such occurrence.  If the value \fIc\fR is not found, then \fBNULL\fR
is returned.
.PP
\fBMemcmp\fR compares two arrays of bytes, \fIs\fR and \fIs2\fR, in
order, until a difference is found or \fIn\fR bytes have been compared.
It returns a value greater than zero if, in the first differing byte,
the value \fIs\fR is greater than the value in \fIs2\fR.  If the value
in \fIs\fR is less than the value in \fIs2\fR, then a value less than
zero is returned.  If the two arrays are identical in their first \fIn\fR
bytes, then zero is returned.  Signed character comparison is used.
.PP
\fBMemcpy\fR copies \fIn\fR bytes from \fIsource\fR to \fIdest\fR and
returns \fIdest\fR as its result.
.PP
\fBMemset\fR stores the value \fIc\fR in each of the \fIn\fR bytes starting
at \fIdest\fR, and returns \fIdest\fR as its result.
