 *
 *	This procedure is called by a client to initialize the information
 *	associated with a stream.  This procedure is used by special-purpose
 *	clients that provide their own low-level I/O;  for normal file I/O,
 *	use fopen, freopen, or fdopen.
 *
 * Results:
 *	None.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	The contents of stream are modified to set up for buffered I/O.
 *	After this call has been made, the stream may be used in other
 *	calls (e.g. getc and putc) to actually perform I/O.
