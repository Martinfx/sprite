 * ungetc --
 *
 *	This procedure adds a single character back to the front of a
 *	stream, so that it will be the next character read from the
 *	stream.  This procedure is only guaranteed to work once in a
 *	row for any stream until getc is called again.  Successive
 *	calls may eventually back up to the beginning of the stream's
 *	buffer, in which case future attempts to put characters back will
 *	be ignored.
 *
 * Results:
 *	EOF is returned if there was insufficient space left in the
 *	buffer to push c back.  Otherwise c is returned.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	The stream is modified so that the next getc call for the
 *	stream will return c.
