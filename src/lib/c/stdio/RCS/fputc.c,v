 *
 *	This procedure outputs a character onto a stream.  It is a
 *	procedural version of the putc macro, and also gets
 *	called by putc when the output buffer has filled.
 *
 * Results:
 *	The return value is EOF if an error occurred while writing
 *	to the stream, or if the stream isn't writable.  Otherwise
 *	it's the value of the character written.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Characters are buffered up for stream.

     * This is tricky because of two things:
     *    a) The stream could be used both for reading and writing.  If
     *       the last access was a read access, or if the stream has never
     *	     been used for writing, "turn the stream around" before doing
     *	     the write. 
     *    b) The stream may be unbuffered (want to output each character
     *       as it comes).  To handle this, call the writeProc as soon
     *       as the buffer fills, rather than delaying until a character
     *	     arrives that doesn't fit.
     *	  c) Keep the notion of "writeCount" separate from the notion of
     *	     "all buffer space in use".  That way, the stream's I/O mgr
     *	     can arrange for itself to be called anytime it wants (even if
     *	     the buffer isn't full) just by making writeCount 1.
