 * clearerr --
 *
 *	This procedure clears out any error conditions associated with
 *	a stream, allowing further I/Os to be done (or at least
 *	attempted) on the stream.
 *
 * Results:
 *	None.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	The error and end-of-file fields are cleared in stream.  Once
 *	an error has been recorded for a stream, no I/O will be attempted
 *	on the stream until the error has been cleared.  Similarly, once
 *	an EOF has occurred on a stream, no further input will occur
 *	until the EOF has explicitly been cleared.
