.SH INTRODUCTION
.PP
The \fBList_\fR\ routines define the ``list'' abstraction, 
which enables one to link
together arbitrary data structures.  Lists are doubly-linked and
circular.  A list contains a header followed by its real members, if
any.  (An empty list therefore consists of a single element, the
header,  whose \fInextPtr\fR and \fIprevPtr\fR fields point to itself).
To refer
to a list as a whole, the user keeps a pointer to the header; that
header is initialized by a call to \fBList_Init()\fR, which
creates an empty
list given a pointer to a List_Links structure (described below).
.PP
The links are contained in a two-element structure called List_Links.
A list joins List_Links records (that is, each List_Links structure
points to other List_Links structures), but if the List_Links is the
first field within a larger structure, then the larger structures are
effectively linked together as shown in Figure 1.
.if t \{
.bp
.sp 2
.GS C
file fig.g
width 5i
.GE
.\}
.PP
A typical structure might be something like:

.nf
     typedef struct {
                 List_Links links;
                 char ch;
                 int flags;
     } EditChar;
.fi
.LP
It is possible to link structures through List_Links fields that are
not at the beginning of the larger structure, but it is then necessary
to perform an additional pointer indirection to find the beginning of
the larger 
structure, given a pointer to some point within it.  The easiest way to do 
this is to define a structure that contains a List_Links field and a pointer
to the larger structure, such as:
.nf
     typedef struct {
                 List_Links links;
                 LargeStruct *structPtr;
     } LargeStructLink;
.fi
.LP
By including a ``LargeStructLink'' within a ``LargeStruct'' and setting the
structPtr field of the LargeStructLink to point to the LargeStruct
itself, LargeStruct structures may be linked together in a list
that is contained in the middle of the structure rather than the beginning.

.SH USAGE
.PP
After a list has been initialized by calling \fBList_Init\fR, elements may
be inserted, deleted, or moved within the list.  
Before an element is inserted in a list for the first time it must
be initialized by calling the routine \fBList_InitElement\fR.  To insert a
List_Links element into a list, \fBList_Insert\fR is called with two
arguments.  The first argument is a pointer to the structure to be
inserted into a list, and the second argument is a pointer to the list
member after which it is to be inserted.  Typically, the following
macros are used to select the insertion point or the destination of a
\fBList_Move\fR:
.IP
.RS
.IP "\(bu \fBLIST_BEFORE\fR(\fIitemPtr\fR)" 30
Insert the element before \fI*itemPtr\fR.
.IP "\(bu \fBLIST_AFTER\fR(\fIitemPtr\fR)" 30
Insert the element after \fI*itemPtr\fR.
.IP "\(bu \fBLIST_ATFRONT\fR(\fIheaderPtr\fR)" 30
Insert the element at the front of the list.
.IP "\(bu \fBLIST_ATREAR\fR(\fIheaderPtr\fR)" 30
Insert the element at the end of the list.
.RE
.PP
.VS
To insert a list into another list, call \fBList_ListInsert\fR with the
header of the list to be inserted and a pointer to the member of the second
list after which the first list is to be inserted.  After calling
\fBList_ListInsert\fP, the header of the first list is no longer valid
and may be destroyed.
.VE
.PP
To remove a structure from a list, call \fBList_Remove\fR with a
pointer to the structure to be removed.  
To move a structure, call \fBList_Move\fR with two arguments: a pointer to
the structure to be moved, and a pointer to the structure after which
it is to be placed.  \fBList_Move\fR(\fIitemPtr\fR, \fIdestPtr\fR) is therefore
equivalent to \fBList_Remove\fR(\fIitemPtr\fR) followed by \fBList_Insert\fR(\fIitemPtr\fR,
\fIdestPtr\fR).

.SH ADDITIONAL UTILITIES
.PP
Several other macros are available for the manipulation of List_Links.
\fBLIST_FORALL\fR(\fIheaderPtr\fR, \fIitemPtr\fR) is used to step through each element
in the list pointed to by headerPtr, setting itemPtr to point to each
element in turn.  \fBLIST_FORALL\fR is used typically by casting \fIitemPtr\fR as
a pointer to the entire structure, as in:
.nf
	List_Links *headerPtr;	/* pointer to head of existing list */
	List_Links *itemPtr;	/* place-holder during loop */
	EditChar   *charPtr;	/* pointer to entire EditChar structure */

	LIST_FORALL(headerPtr, itemPtr) {
		charPtr = (EditChar *) itemPtr;
		/* operations using charPtr */
	}
.fi
.PP
The following macros may be useful to those who use List_Links at a
``lower'' level than looping through an entire list:
.RS
.IP "\(bu \fBList_IsEmpty\fR(\fIheaderPtr\fR) " 30
returns TRUE if \fIheaderPtr\fR points to an empty
list.
.IP "\(bu \fBList_IsAtEnd\fR(\fIheaderPtr\fR, \fIitemPtr\fR)" 30
returns TRUE if \fIitemPtr\fR is
past the end of the list; i.e., it points to the header.
.IP "\(bu \fBList_First\fR(\fIheaderPtr\fR) " 30
.IP "\(bu \fBList_Last\fR(\fIheaderPtr\fR) " 30
\fBList_First\fR returns the first member in a list, and
\fBList_Last\fR returns the last member.  If the list is empty,
the header is considered to be the first and last member.
.IP "\(bu \fBList_Prev\fR(\fIitemPtr\fR) " 30
returns a pointer to the member preceding the given
member in its list.  
.IP "\(bu \fBList_Next\fR(\fIitemPtr\fR)" 30
returns the next
member of the list.
