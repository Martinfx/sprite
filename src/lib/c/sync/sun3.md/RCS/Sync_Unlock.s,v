/*
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Sync_Unlock --
 *
 *      Release a lock.  This is called at the end of a critical
 *      section of code to allow other processes to execute within the
 *      critical section.  If any processes are waiting to acquire this
 *      lock they are made runnable.  They will try to gain the lock
 *      again the next time they run.
 *
 * Results:
 *	None.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	The lock is cleared.  Processes waiting on the lock are made runnable.
 *
 * C equivalent:
 *
 *	void
 *	Sync_Unlock(lockPtr)
 *	    Sync_Lock *lockPtr;
 *	{
 *	    lockPtr->inUse = 0;
 *	    if (lockPtr->waiting) {
 *		Sync_SlowBroadcast((int)lockPtr, &lockPtr->waiting);
 *	    }
 *	}
