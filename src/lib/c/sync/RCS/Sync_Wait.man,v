.SH NAME
Sync_Wait \- wait on a monitor condition variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <sync.h>\fR
.sp .5
\fBSync_Wait\fR(\fIconditionPtr, wakeIfSignal\fP)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Sync_Condition *conditionPtr
.AP Sync_Condition *conditionPtr in
Address of a condition variable 
to distinguish waiting process for later notification.
.AP Boolean wakeIfSignal in
This parameter is currently ignored.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBSync_Wait\fR allows a process using a monitor to wait for a particular condition.
This routine can only be called while a monitor lock is aquired because 
it is only safe to check global state while in the monitor.  
This call releases the monitor lock and makes the process sleep on the
condition. Other processes waiting on the monitor lock will become runnable.
The process remains asleep until some other process invokes
\fBSync_Broadcast\fR with the same condition variable.
.PP
Because broadcast semantics are used, it is possible for spurious wakeups to
occur if multiple processes are awaiting the same condition.  Additionally,
all processes waiting on \fI*conditionPtr\fP will be
awakened simultaneously and may execute in any order.  For these
reasons, when a process resumes execution it may find that the condition
it was awaiting is no longer valid.  In this case,
it should call \fBSync_Wait\fR again.
.PP
When the
process awakens due to event notification through \fBSync_Broadcast\fR,
\fBSUCCESS\fR is returned.
