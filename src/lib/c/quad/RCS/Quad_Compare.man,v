.SH NAME
Quad_CompareUns, Quad_EQ \- Comparison routines for 64-bit integers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <quad.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBQuad_CompareUns\fR(\fIuQuad1Ptr\fR, \fIuQuad2Ptr\fR)
.sp
Boolean
\fBQuad_EQ\fR(\fIuQuad1\fR, \fIuQuad2\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS u_quad *uQuad1Ptr
.AP u_quad uQuadN in
N'th unsigned quad argument.
.AP u_quad *uQuadNPtr in
Pointer to N'th unsigned quad argument.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These routines compare two 64-bit integers.
.B Quad_CompareUns
compares two unsigned quads, returning \-1 if the first value is less
than the second, 0 if they are equal, and +1 if the first value is
greater than the second.  It was designed for use with
.BR qsort .
.PP
.B Quad_EQ
compares two quads or unsigned quads, returning TRUE if they are equal
and FALSE if they are not.
.B Quad_EQ
is a macro, so beware of side effects.

.SH KEYWORDS
quad, counter
