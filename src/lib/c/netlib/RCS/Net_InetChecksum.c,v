     *  1) add the two unsigned 16-bit quantities, 
     *  2) if there was a carry out of the high-order bit, 
     *	   it is added to the sum.
     * To detect a carry out of the high-order bit, the sum is stored
     * in a 32-bit word. As an optimization, we delay step 2 until
     * all the words have been added together. At that point, the
     * upper-half of the sum contains the sum of the carries from the
     * additions. This value is then added to the lower half and if that
     * operation causes a carry, then 1 is added to the sum.
     *
     * The optimization does place a limit on how many bytes can be
     * summed without causing an overflow of the 32-bit sum. In the worst
     * case, a maximum of 64K additions of 16-bit values can be added
     * without overflow.
     * 
     * The summation is done in an unrolled loop. Once we have less than 
     * 32 bytes to sum then it must be done in smaller loops.
