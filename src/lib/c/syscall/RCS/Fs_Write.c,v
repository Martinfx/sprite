 *
 * Fs_Write --
 *
 *      The "normal" Fs_Write interface for user code.  Writes writeLength
 *      characters from buffer to the file identified by streamID.
 *      *amtWrittenPtr is updated to reflect how much data were actually
 *      written.
 *
 *      For some kinds of devices, Fs_Write causes the calling process to
 *      block until the device is ready to accept the data.  If a signal
 *      is received by the process while it is blocked, then the
 *      Fs_RawWrite system call will be aborted in order to process the
 *      signal.  When (if) the signal returns, the system call will return
 *      a GEN_ABORTED_BY_SIGNAL status, and *writeCountPtr will reflect
 *      the number of bytes accepted by the device before the signal
 *      occurred.  This routine will detect this occurrence and
 *      automatically restart the system call to write the remainder of
 *      the data.
 *
 * Results:
 *	An error code.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	The file offset is incremented to be after the data written.
 *	The amtWrittenPtr is updated to reflect the amount actually written.
 *
