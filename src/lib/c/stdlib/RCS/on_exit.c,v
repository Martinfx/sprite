 * on_exit --
 *
 *	Register a function ("func") to be called as part of process
 *	exiting.  One argment can be passed.
 *
 * Results:
 *	The return value is 0 if the registration was successful,
 *	and -1 if registration failed because the table was full.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Information will be remembered so that when the process exits
 *	(by calling the "exit" procedure), func will be called.  Func
 *	takes no arguments and returns no result.  If the process
 *	terminates in some way other than by calling exit, then func
 *	will not be invoked.
