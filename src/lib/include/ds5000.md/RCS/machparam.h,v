 * machparam.h --
 *
 *	This file contains various machine-dependent parameters needed
 *	by UNIX programs running under Sprite.  This file includes parts
 *	of the UNIX header files "machine/machparm.h" and
 *	"machine/endian.h".  Many of things in the UNIX file are only
 *	useful for the kernel;  stuff gets added to this file only
 *	when it's clear that it is needed for user programs.
