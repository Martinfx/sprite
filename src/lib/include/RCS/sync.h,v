 * sync.h --
 *
 * 	Typedefs and macros to support the use of monitors.
 *      Clients use the macros to acquire and release monitor locks, and
 *      to wait on and notify monitored condition variables.  Only Broadcast
 *      semantics are supported for lock release; that is, all processes
 *      waiting on a lock are made runnable when the locked is released.
 *
 *      These macros do a fast check on the state of the lock or condition
 *      variable to reduce overhead.  In the best case the lock and unlock
 *      routines just set or clear flags.  In the worst case these routines
 *      have to call slower routines that must acquire a master lock.

 *
 * The user locks are different from the kernel locks. If we are compiling
 * user code then the Sync_UserLock type is typedef'ed to be Sync_Lock.
 * The Sync_UserLock type is used by the kernel to differentiate between

 * Monitor Locks --
 *
 *	The following set of macros are used to emulate monitored
 *	procedures of Mesa.  The Sprite style document has a complete
 *	description of the conventions required to emulate a set
 *	of monitored procedures; a summary is presented here.
 *
 *      The LOCK_MONITOR and UNLOCK_MONITOR macros depend on a constant
 *      LOCKPTR.  LOCKPTR should be defined as the address of the lock
 *      variable used to lock the monitor.  Something like the following
 *      two lines of code should appear at the beginning of a file of
 *      monitored procedures.
 *
 *	Sync_Lock modMonitorLock;
 *	#define LOCKPTR (&modMonitorLock)
 *
 *	The pseudo-keywords INTERNAL and ENTRY denote internal and entry
 *	procedures of a monitor.  INTERNAL procedures can only be called
 *	when the monitor lock is held.  ENTRY procedures are procedures
 *	that acquire the lock.  There may also be External procedures.
 *	They are the default and there is no special keyword.  An External
 *	procedure doesn't explicitly acquire the monitor lock, but may
 *	call an ENTRY procedure.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Sync_Wait --
 *
 * Wait on a condition variable.  This can only be called while a lock
 * is aquired because it is only safe to check global state while in a
 * monitor.  This releases the monitor lock and makes the process sleep
 * on the condition. The monitor lock is reacquired after the process 
 * has been woken up.
 *
 * The address of the condition variable is used as the generic 'event'
 * that the process blocks on.  The value of the condition variable is
 * used to indicate if there is a process waiting on the condition.
 *
 * Results:
 *	None.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Put the process to sleep and release the monitor lock.

 *      Notify other processes that a condition has been met.  If the
 *      condition variable indicates that there are processes waiting
 *      on the condition, then Sync_SlowBroadcast is used to wakeup
 *      waiting processes.
 *
