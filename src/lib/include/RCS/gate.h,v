/*
 * A gateway information file contains listings of gateway definitions,
 * one per line.  Each line has the form:
 *
 *     <descr> <netType> <netAddr> <inetAddr>
 *
 *
 *      descr               One word description of the gateway.
 *	netType 	    Type of local network by which the gateway is
 *	    	  	    connected.  Currently, only `ether', `ultra',
 *	    	  	    and `fddi' are understood.
 *	netAddr	  	    Address for the local network of the given type.
 *	inetAddr  	    The internet address of the network interface
 *                          of the host.
 *
 * When routes are installed to specific hosts on a machine, those routes
 * need to know the net addresses (e.g., ethernet address) of those
 * machines.  However, if the host is on another subnet, then the route
 * should use the net address of the gateway to that subnet instead of
 * the net address of the host.  The decision to route to the host
 * directly or to a gateway is done at route installation time, based
 * upon the internet address of the host.  The route installation
 * routines use the gateway file to translate internet addresses of hosts
 * on different subnets to net addresses to gateways to those hosts.
