This directory contains include files that describe device-specific
characteristics of Sprite I/O devices.  Typically, each file describes
the Fs_IOControl operations implemented by that device, and any
structures passed to or from the device handler via Fs_IOControls.
Generic Fs_IOControl operations (those that are implemented for
many or all device and file types) are described in
/sprite/lib/include/fs.h.

Corresponding to each I/O device is an index, which appears in the
high-order 16 bits of the operation code for each Fs_IOControl for
that device.  The current indices are listed below.  Add new ones when
you define new kinds of devices.

generic operations (fs.h)		0
terminals (tty.h)			1
pseudo-devices (pdev.h)			2
magnetic tapes (tape.h)			3
network protocols (net.h)		4
write-once optical disks (worm.h)	5
pseudo-file-systems (pfs.h)		6
graphics devices (graphics.h)		7
