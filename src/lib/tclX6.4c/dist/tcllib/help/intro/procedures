     PROCEDURES
          Tcl allows you to extend the command interface  by  defining
          procedures.   A  Tcl  procedure can be invoked just like any
          other Tcl command (it has a name and it receives one or more
          arguments).   The  only  difference is that its body isn't a
          piece of C code linked into the  program;  it  is  a  string
          containing  one  or  more  other Tcl commands.  See the proc
          command for information on how to define procedures and what
          happens when they are invoked.
