     SEPARATING COMMANDS WITH SEMI-COLONS
          Normally, each command occupies one  line  (the  command  is
          terminated  by  a  newline  character).  However, semi-colon
          (``;'')  is  treated  as  a  command  separator   character;
          multiple  commands  may  be placed on one line by separating
          them with a semi-colon.   Semi-colons  are  not  treated  as
          command  separators  if  they  appear within curly braces or
          double-quotes.
