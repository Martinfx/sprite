          lindex list index
               Treats  list  as  a  Tcl  list and returns the index'th
               element from it (0 refers to the first element  of  the
               list).   In extracting the element, lindex observes the
               same rules concerning braces and quotes and backslashes
               as  the  Tcl  command  interpreter;  however,  variable
               substitution and command substitution do not occur.  If
               index  is  negative  or  greater  than  or equal to the
               number of elements in value, then an  empty  string  is
               returned.
