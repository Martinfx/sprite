          continue
               This command may be invoked only inside the body  of  a
               loop  command  such  as  for  or  foreach or while.  It
               returns a  TCL_CONTINUE code to  signal  the  innermost
               containing  loop  command  to skip the remainder of the
               loop's body but continue with the next iteration of the
               loop.
