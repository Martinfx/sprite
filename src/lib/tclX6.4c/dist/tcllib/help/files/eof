          eof fileId
               Returns 1 if an end-of-file condition has  occurred  on
               fileId,  0 otherwise.  FileId must have been the return
               value from a previous call to open, or it may be stdin,
               stdout,  or  stderr to refer to one of the standard I/O
               channels.
