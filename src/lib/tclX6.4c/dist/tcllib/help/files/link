          link [-sym] srcpath destpath
               Create a directory entry, destpath, linking it to the
               existing file, srcpath.  If -sym is specified, a
               symbolic link, rather than a hard link, is created.
               (The -sym option is only available on systems that
               support symbolic links.)
