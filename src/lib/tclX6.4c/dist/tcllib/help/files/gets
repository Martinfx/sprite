          gets fileId ?varName?
               Reads the next line from the file given by  fileId  and
               discards the terminating newline character.  If varName
               is specified, then the line is placed in  the  variable
               by  that  name  and  the return value is a count of the
               number of characters read (not including the  newline).
               If  the  end  of the file is reached before reading any
               characters then -1 is returned and varName is set to an
               empty  string.   If  varName  is not specified then the
               return value  will  be  the  line  (minus  the  newline
               character) or an empty string if the end of the file is
               reached before reading any characters.  An empty string
               will  also be returned if a line contains no characters
               except the newline, so eof  may  have  to  be  used  to
               determine  what really happened.  If the last character
               in the file is  not  a  newline  character,  then  gets
               behaves   as   if  there  were  an  additional  newline
               character at the end of the file.  FileId must be stdin
               or  the  return  value from a previous call to open; it
               must refer to a file that was opened for reading.
