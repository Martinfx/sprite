          read fileId

          read fileId nonewline

          read fileId numBytes
               In  the first form, all of the remaining bytes are read
               from the file given by fileId; they are returned as the
               result of the command.  If nonewline is specified as an
               additional argument, then the  last  character  of  the
               file  is  discarded  if  it is a newline.  In the third
               form, the extra argument specifies how  many  bytes  to
               read;   exactly  this  many  bytes  will  be  read  and
               returned, unless there are fewer  than  numBytes  bytes
               left in the file; in this case, all the remaining bytes
               are returned.  FileId must be stdin or the return value
               from  a  previous call to open; it must refer to a file
               that was opened for reading.
