          fstat handle [item]|[stat arrayvar]
               Obtain status information about an open file.

               The following keys are used to identify data items:

               o atime - The time of last access.

               o ctime - The time of last file status change

               o dev - The device containing a directory for the file.
               This value uniquely identifies the file system that
               contains the file.

               o gid - The group ID of the file's group.

               o ino - The inode number.  This field uniquely
               identifies the file in a given file system.

               o mode - The mode of the file (see the mknod system
               call).

               o mtime - Time when the data in the file was last
               modified.

               o nlink - The number of links to the file.

               o size - The file size in bytes.

               o tty - If the file is associated with a terminal, then
               1 otherwise 0.

               o type - The type of the file in symbolic form, which
               is one of the following values: file, directory,
               characterSpecial, blockSpecial, fifo, link, or socket.

               o uid - The user ID of the file's owner.

               If one of these keys is specified as item, then that
               data item is returned

               If stat arrayvar is specified, then the information is
               returned in the array arrrayvar.  Each of the above
               keys indexes an element of the array containing the
               data.

               If only handle is specified, the command returns the
               data as a keyed list.
