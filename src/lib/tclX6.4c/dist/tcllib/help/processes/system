          system command
               Executes command via the system(3) call.  Differs from
               exec in that system doesn't return the executed
               command's standard output as the result string, and
               system goes through the default shell to provide
               wildcard expansion, redirection, etc, as is normal from
               an sh command line.  The exit code of the command is
               returned.
