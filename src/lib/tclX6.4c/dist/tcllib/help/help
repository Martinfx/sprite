          The help facility allows one to look up help files which
          where extracted from the standard Tcl manual pages and Tcl
          scripts during Tcl installation.  Help files are structured
          as a multilevel directory tree of subjects and help files.
          The following commands and options are provided with the
          help package:

          help
               Help, without arguments, lists of all the top-level
               help subject directories and files.

          help subjectdir
               Displays all of help files and lower level subject
               files (if any exist) under the directory subjectdir.

          help subjectdir/helpfile
               Display the specified help file.  The help output is
               passed through a simple pager if output exceeds 23
               lines, pausing waiting for a return to be entered.  If
               any other character is entered, the output is
               terminated.

          helpcd [subjectdir]
               Change the current subject directory, which is much
               like the Unix current directory.  If subjectdir is not
               specified, return to the top-level of the help tree.
               Help path names may also include ``..'' elements.

          helppwd
               Displays the current help subject directory.

          help help | ?
               Displays help on the help facility at any directory
               level.

          apropos pattern
               This command locates subjects by searching their one-
               line descriptions for a pattern.  Apropos is useful
               when you can remember part of the name or description
               of a command, and want to search through the one-line
               summaries for matching lines.  Full regular expressions
               may be specified (see the regexp command).
