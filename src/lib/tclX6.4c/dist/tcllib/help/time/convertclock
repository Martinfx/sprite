               Convert dateString to an integer clock value (see
               getclock).  This command can parse and convert
               virtually any standard date and/or time string, which
               can include standard time zone mnemonics.  If only a
               time is specified, the current date is assumed.  If the
               string does not contain a time zone mnemonic, the local
               time zone is assumed, unless the GMT argument is
               specified, in which case the clock value is calculated
               assuming that the specified time is relative to
               Greenwich Mean Time.  If baseClock is specified, it is
               taken as the current clock value.  This is useful for
               determining the time on a specific day.  Some examples
               are:

                   convertclock "14 Feb 92"
                   convertclock "Feb 14, 1992 12:20 PM PST"
                   convertclock "12:20 PM, Feb 14, 1992"
