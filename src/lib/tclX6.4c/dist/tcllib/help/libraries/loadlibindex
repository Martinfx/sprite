          loadlibindex libfile
          Load the package library index of the library file libfile
          (which must have the suffix .tlib).  Package library indexes
          along the TCLPATH are loaded automatically on the first
          demand_load; this command is provided to explicitly load
          libraries that are not in the path.  If the index file (with
          a .tndx suffix) does not exists or is out of date, it will
          be rebuilt if the user has directory permissions to create
          it. Duplicated package names are skipped.

          This command will also load an index built by mkindex.tcl
          program supplied with standard Tcl.  This file must be named
          "tclIndex".
