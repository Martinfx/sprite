                         * Changes to Extended Tcl *
===============================================================================
13 Nov 91: Extended Tcl 6.1a released
===============================================================================
20 Nov 91: 
  o Fixed use of invalid variable when reporting an error in 
    test/unixcmds.test.
  o Changed temporary files names so they are 14 characters or less in 
    test/chmod.test..
  o Changed TCL_MAN_SECTION for SCO Unix to be "TCL" instead of "tcl".
  o Modified src/main.c to be independent of the internal Tcl include files.
  o Changed ar to not use the 'u' option in makes.
  o For ucbsrc, delete the objects explicitly from libtcl.a, since sometimes
    the modified version tclBasic.o was not replacing the standard version.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29 Nov 91:
  o Added configuration section for older versions of SunOS.
  o Added an strtoul replacement for HP/UX, since their version accepts
    negative numbers.
  o Converted the global tclxPatchlevel from a string to an int.
  o Modified test for chmod +t, since this will actually change the file mode
    if run as root.  Changed chown tests to compare file group id against the 
    effective group id, in case tests are run with the effective group id
    changed.
  o Fixed bad error message from id command when user or group name does not
    exist.
  o Made tclSignalReceived a external flag that can be checked by C code to
    determine if signal a signal is pending.
  o Corrected the spelling of the variable 'signalReceived' that is set when
    trap code is by a signal (signal command). (*POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*)
  o Changed code in src/createExtd.c that is supposed to force math error to
    be included so that an optimizer doesn't decide to throw away the external
    reference.
  o Modified commandloop to reset command buffer when a signal is recieved,
    enabling interrupting the input of multi-line commands.
  o Fixed problem with math error tests were pow did not return an error on
    some systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29 Nov 91: tests/all, tests/fmath.test, tests/math.test, tests/loop.test,
           tests/filescan.test
  o Converted to current test support routines: fmath.test, math.test and
    loop.test.
  o Removed tests/testutil.test, as its no longer needed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30 Nov 91:
  o Made detection of _tolower and _toupper automatic, instead of a 
    configuration option.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2 Dec 91:
  o Updated showproc.tcl with Lance Ellinghouse's improved version that dumps
    default argument info.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 5 Dec 91:
  o Fixed bug with doing a keylget on an empty string.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4 Jan 92:
  o Fixed BinSearch so it doesn't overwrite the error returned by
    TclGetOpenFile with another error message.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 5 Jan 92:
  o Fixed link and unlink commands to do tilde substitution.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 9 Jan 92:
  o Fixed problem with Boyer-Moore optimization causing scanfile to fail
    matches when the regular expression contains ORs (|).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 10 Jan 92:
  o Convert execvp to execl to support passing arguments as a list, rather than
    a series of parameters.  Added a execvp to the Tcl procedure library to
    provide backwards compatibility.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 11 Jan 92: man/TclX.man
  o Changes to make some manual sections more readable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 13 Feb 92:
  o Added `procs' option to cmdtrace that traces procedure calls only.
  o Added `-nocomplain' flag to unlink command.
  o Changed package index structure so the file name is not included in the
    index file.
  o Added support for optional #@packend, to mark end of packages.
  o Merged in changes to support A/UX 2.01 (supplied by Parag Patel)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 15 Feb 92:
  o Modified keylget to return a list of keyes in a keyed list if no field
    name is spefieied.  Added Tcl_GetKeyedListKeys to support this operation.
  o Added keyed list sub field support (i.e. FOO.BAZ).
  o Added type attribute to the values returned by the fstat command to give
    it the same functionality as the Tcl6.2 file command.
  o Update help files based on the ucb manual pages and added help for
    standard built-in variables.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 16 Feb 92:
  o Modified install script to unlink manual pages before it links to new ones.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 23 Feb 92:
  o Moved the external declaration of variables set by the startup code
    to tclExtended.h.
  o Made startup more modular to support applications like Tk.  Made setting
    of globals variables for infox in the main optional.  If not set, start up
    sets them to a default.  (All backwards compatible).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2 Mar 92:
  o Added -sym option to link command to support symbolic links.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3 Mar 92:
  o Modified keylset to take multiple keyword/value pairs.
  o Moved all tcl++.h vararg routines into tcl++.C, since inlined varargs
    don't work right with some compilers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  4 Mar 92:
  o Added catopen, catgets and catclose commands.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 11 Mar 92:
  o Combined TclShell.man and tcl.tlib.man with TclX.man to put all
    documentation for Tcl language programing in one manual page.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 13 Mar 92:
  o Moved configuration from the toplevel Makefile to Config.mk, which is now
    included by all Makefiles and parsed by the install script.
  o Changed all calls to cc use the $(CC) macro.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 19 Mar 92:
  o Fixed bug in command loop were certain set commands were valid commands,
    but invalid lists.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 24 Mar 92:
  o Added support for numBytes or nonewline to `read_file' procedure.
  o Added lgets command to read lists from a file, included embedded newlines.
===============================================================================
 4 Mar 92: Extended Tcl 6.2b released
===============================================================================
 7 Apr 92: 
   o Fixed bug were no error message was returned with the TCLDEFAULT file
     could not be found.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13 Arp 92: 
   o Moved definition of CLK_TCK if its undefined until after the place were
     time.h might be included in tclExtdInt.h.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15 Apr 92:
   o Added TCL_TIMEZONE_VAR option for systems that don't return the timezone
     offset in `struct tm'.
   o Deleted test from tests/clock.test that returned a different result in
     a different timezone.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27 Apr 92:
   o Fixed bug in fstat that caused the keyed list get of all status data
     to return invalid data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 May 92:
   o Moved setting of prompt hooks before source ~/.tclrc so that prompts can
     be modified in the .~/tclrc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3 May 92:
   o Changed src/Makefile to use CCPLUSINCL.
   o Fixed cast problems in src/clock.c and src/tcl++.c
   o Added SGI and IBM RS6000 to Config.mk based on billa@msi.com (Bill
     Alexander) porting.  Thses probably need more work..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4 May 92:
   o Added tcl 6.3 fixes to ucbsrc/tclBasic.c
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11 May 92:
   o Delete closing of pipes from Tcl_System.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14 May 92:
   o Changed floating point math command to take expressions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18 May 92:
   o Fixed bug in lvarpop were it core dumps if passed variable containing an
     invalid list.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28 May 92:
   o Fixed search path so it does not return an error when a path contains
     an invalid ~user.  
   o Fixed keyedlists from occasionally returning incorrect error with no
     error message when adding a field to an empty list.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10 Jun 92:
   o Update chmod tests to not make assumptions about what group id a file
     as created with.
   o Added support for implementations that indicate floating point errors from
     math functions by returning not-a-number, rather than calling matherr.
   o Changed cindex, crange, csubstr and replicate to take integer
     expresssions.
   o Improved documentation of Tcl_ShellEnvInit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14 Jun 92:
   o Changed tclEdtdInt.h to use declare command executors as ANSI prototypes
     instead of being of type Tcl_CmdProc, since this broke a DEC compiler.
   o Fixed loop command so that the control variable is left at its
     terminating value, not the previous value.
   o Fixed Tcl_Startup so if used the defaultFile passed in, rather than
     assuming the compiled default value.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28 Jun 92:
   o Fixed bug where a SIGINTR will sometimes cause the command loop to panic.
   o To speed up package library index loading, changed the .tndx file to only
     contain data, not commands to be sourced.  Added Tcl procedure to convert
     Ousterhout-style tclIndex files into package libraries.
   o Fixed problem with cmdtrace of procedures that have empty bodies.  Also
     simplified and optimized the code for tracing procedures.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30 Jun 92:
   o Fixed ShellEnvInit member function in tcl++.h.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12 Jul 92:
   o Added profile command and profrep procedure.
   o Changed alarm command to take floating point seconds and use setitimer
     when available.
   o Moved the system dependent parts of Config.mk to seperate files in a
     directory called config.  A #define in Config.mk now indicates which file
     to use.
   o Droped the -i flag from the chmod command for compatibility with Tcl open
     command changes.  Octal numbers must be prefixed with a "0".
     *** Potential compatibility problem ***
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31 Jul 92:
   o Fix max command so it works for negative numbers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9 Aug 92:
   o Changed build of ucbsrc and tkSupport so that the modified files are
     built from the original files using sed.
   o Imporved autoloading, including not searching path if file name contains
     directories.  Demand_load searchs "auto_path" if it can't find the proc
     anywhere else, this should help Tk programs that dynamicly add directories
     to the variable.  This code moved to C to speed it up.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12 Aug 92:
   o Made message catalog table process global, so a message catalog handle
     is valid in all interpreters in a process.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21 Aug 92:
   o Added support for building a wish with signals.
   o Fix bug where errorCode on a signal was not in the documented format.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23 Aug 92:
   o Added lvarpush command.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 Sept 92:
   o Converted loading of Tcl library indexes from Tcl to C to speed up these
     operations.
   o Changed fcntl attributes to be named line the Posix standards:  NDELAY is
     changed to NONBLOCK and CLEXEC to CLOEXEC. Fcntl nolonger returns a list
     of current values on query, instead individule values may be queried.
     This makes it easier to use in the normal case and better allows for
     future expansion.  (*POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 Sept 92:
   o Changed the signal command to return a keyed list for signal state query.
     Include the command associated with signals that are "trap".  This makes
     it easier to restore the state of signals that you change.
     (*POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7 Sept 92:
   o Automatically build a Tk .tlib.
   o Added installation of Extended Tk to the install script.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11 Sept 92:
   o Changed select to check read stdio buffers for pending data.  This way
     the files do not have to be unbuffered.
   o Added ability  to get a list of keys for a subfield to function
     Tcl_GetKeyedListKeys.  This necessitated adding a parameter.
     (*POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*)
   o Added kelykeys command to return lists of keys from a keyed list.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14 Sept 92:
   o Changed the fstat command to make it easier to use and more consistent
     with the file command.  This forced a syntax chang for fstat commands
     were the data is returned in an array variable.
     (*POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*)
   o Added tty option to fstat (interface to isatty).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20 Sept 92:
   o Changed package library loading so that duplicate package names found in
     a path are loaded.
   o Added the -location options to the packages command.
   o Changed write_file to take multiple strings.
   o Added lvarcat command.
   o Reorganized Makefiles to simplify and fix some make problems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 Oct 92:
   o Wait command was changed to take only one pid.  This is in preparation
     for supporting full waitpid functionallity once the support has been
     added to UCB Tcl.  (*POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2 Oct 92:
  o Reorganized help categories.
  o Changed floating point commands to always return floating point numbers
    without lose of precision or demotion to integer.
  o Patch the UCB tclExpr.c file to return doubles without lose of precision.
    This is temporary until a fix is povided in the UCB code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4 Oct 92:
  o Fixed behavior of Posix signals and SIGCHLD.
  o Added block and unblock options.
  o Added return of block state in the get option.
  o Fixed potential bug in lrmdup.
  o Process signals when encountered in the command loop rather than just clear
    them.
  o Stored the "wrong # args: " string in a single global  variable to save
    memory rather than repeating in each command.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 5 Oct 92:
  o Fixed bug in for_recursive_glob with continue and break not working as
    expected.
  o Delete chamge bar macros when installing manual pages.
  o Changed startup so if no longer looks for a local TCLDEFAULT file.  Initial
    tests are now run by setting the environment variable.
  o Fixed bug in chmod were set permissions for two difference classes (u,g,o)
    with = in the same command did not work.
  o Changed help and buildhelp.tcl so that multiple brief files are allowed
    (extension .brf).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 7 Oct 92:
  o Signal handling changed so that if multiple signals are received before
    before they are handle and if trap code is associated with that signal,
    then the trap code will be run once for every signal received.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 8 Oct 92:
  o Recoded assign_fields to use upvar.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11 Oct 92:
  o Modified install script to purge the target help tree before installing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12 Oct 92:
  o Added a options argument to Tcl_Startup.  It is not currrently used.
   (*POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*)
===============================================================================
15 Oct 92: Extended Tcl 6.4c released
===============================================================================
24 Oct 92:
  o Fixed problem in tclXprocess were it will not compile if wait status
    is union wait.
  o Fixed minor manual page problems.
  o Corrected problems in RS/6000 config file.
  o Fixed problem with buildhelp.tcl always truncating filenames.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27 Oct 92:
  o Added configure file for new version of Ultrix (4.2+).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 7 Nov 92:
  o Fixed problems with convertclock timezones on some machines.
  o Added config file for ultrix4.2
  o Deleted strtoul from osSupport directory and config files.  This is now
    compiled with UCB Tcl if needed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 8 Nov 92:
  o Use our own strftime for SGI since their's is broken.
  o Added changes to fix problems with systems using IEEE floating point math
    error reporting.
===============================================================================
 9 Oct 92: Extended Tcl 6.4c patch1 released
