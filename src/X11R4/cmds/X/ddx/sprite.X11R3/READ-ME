	How to add CG6 support to Xsun for X11R3.

modify sunInit.c :

add the following to the list of extern's at the top of the file.

	extern Bool sunCG6Probe();


modify the sunFbDataRec declaration by adding an entry for the cg6 as
follows:

	#ifdef ZOIDS
	sunFbDataRec sunFbData[] = {
	    sunBW2Probe,  	"/dev/bwtwo0",	    neverProbed,	0, 0,
	    sunCG2CProbe,  	"/dev/cgtwo0",	    neverProbed,	0, 0,
	    sunCG3CProbe,  	"/dev/cgthree0",    neverProbed,	0, 0,
	    sunCG4CProbe,  	"/dev/cgfour0",	    neverProbed,	0, 0,
	    sunCG6Probe,  	"/dev/cgsix0",	    neverProbed,	0, 0,
	};
	#else  ZOIDS
	sunFbDataRec sunFbData[] = {
	    sunBW2Probe,  	"/dev/bwtwo0",	    neverProbed,
	    sunCG2CProbe,  	"/dev/cgtwo0",	    neverProbed,
	    sunCG3CProbe,  	"/dev/cgthree0",    neverProbed,
	    sunCG4CProbe,  	"/dev/cgfour0",	    neverProbed,
	    sunCG6Probe,  	"/dev/cgsix0",	    neverProbed,
	};
	#endif ZOIDS



modify Imakefile:

	Add sunCG6.c and sunCG6.o


To start Xsun you MUST specify -dev /dev/cgsix0 or else the auto
config code seems to think that it is a cg4.
