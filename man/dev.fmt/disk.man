     Disk devices are used to read and write sectors on  magnetic
     disk devices.  Each rreeaadd or wwrriittee kernel call on a disk dev-
     ice may access one or  more  sectors  on  the  device.   The
     buffer  specified  to  the kernel call must be a multiple of
     the disk's sector size,  normally  512  bytes.   Reading  or
     writing disk sectors advances the file pointer to the sector
     after the last one accessed. The llsseeeekk kernel  call  may  be
     used to position the file pointer to any sector.

     A disk may be divided into eight possibly overlapping ranges
     of  disk  sectors  called  partitions.  The  partitions  are
     defined by a structure called a disk label which resides  in
     the  first  sector  of  the  disk.   The  label structure is
     defined in the include file <kernel/devDiskLabel.h>.  Tradi-
     tionally,  partitions  have  been  named  by  the  letters aa
     through hh.  Partition cc  is  normally  used  to  access  the
     entire disk.

UUNNIITT NNUUMMBBEERRSS
     For disk devices, the least significant  four  bits  of  the
     unit  number are used to select the partition. A unit number
     of zero implies partition aa while seven implies partition hh.
     The entire disk can be accessed using a unit number of eight
     regardless of the partitioning defined by  the  label.  Unit
     number  eight  is useful for writing a label to an unlabeled
     disk.
