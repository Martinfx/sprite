     /etc/spritehosts - file containing Sprite host information

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The file //eettcc//sspprriitteehhoossttss is used to keep  host  information
     for  hosts in the Sprite network.  It contains the following
     fields:

     spriteID      A small integer  used  to  identify  the  host
                   internally.

     netType       The type of the physical network for the  fol-
                   lowing nneettAAddddrr field.

     netAddr       The physical network address of the host.

     inetAddr      The Internet address of the host.

     machType      The machine type of  the  host.   This  string
                   will   be   substituted   for  occurrences  of
                   $$MMAACCHHIINNEE that occur  in  pathnames  opened  by
                   this host.

     name          The official Internet name of this host.

     aliases       Zero or more aliases, typically  shorter  than
                   the official Internet name.

     This file is read during startup by the nneettrroouuttee program  to
     initialize  the  kernel's  internal  route table.  Actually,
     routing will be done successfully without  this  initializa-
     tion.   However,  the initialization is needed on servers so
     they know the machine type of their  clients.   Also,  error
     messages  from  the kernel will use the host name instead of
     the spriteID if the initialization has been done.
