     /sprite/admin/migInfo - file containing the migration status
     of all Sprite hosts

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The migration status of all Sprite hosts is stored in  ASCII
     format  in  a  shared file, //sspprriittee//aaddmmiinn//mmiiggIInnffoo. Each host
     runs a daemon that is responsible for updating the  informa-
     tion  for  its host.  Each record is fixed length, to permit
     the daemons to update individual records without first pars-
     ing the entire file.

     Each record contains the following information, separated by
     white space:

     hostID        numeric identifier of host.

     utilizations  3 weighted CPU utilizations,  as  percentages,
                   separated by slashes.

     ready queues  3 weighted queue lengths,  as  floating-point,
                   separated by slashes.

     boottime      time at  which  host  last  rebooted  (seconds
                   since 1/1/70).

     timestamp     time when record last updated, (seconds  since
                   1/1/70).

     noInput       number of  seconds  since  keyboard  or  mouse
                   input.

     allowMigration
                   whether process  migration  to  this  host  is
                   allowed .

     foreignProcs  number of migrated processes running  on  this
                   host.

     migVersion    version number of migration  running  on  this
                   host.

     pad           Reserved for future expansion.

     Although the information is stored in ASCII format, to  make
     it  sharable  by  machines  with  different  byte orderings,
     internally the migration database is accessed  via  routines
     that  convert  between  ASCII  and  an internal C structure.
     Refer to the documentation for the mmiigg library for  informa-
     tion about this structure.
