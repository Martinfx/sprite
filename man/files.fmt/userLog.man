     /sprite/admin/userLog, /sprite/admin/lastLog  -  files  con-
     taining information about user logins

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Each time a user logs into a sprite host, the system records
     information  about  the  login in two files.  Each record in
     each file is a fixed-length ASCII string,  so  a  particular
     record  may  be updated without the need to read and rewrite
     all other records in the file.

     One file records information on a per-host basis, while  the
     other records information about the last login of each user.
     The per-host file, //sspprriittee//aaddmmiinn//uusseerrLLoogg, has one record for
     each  ``port''  of  each host.  The ports are numbered, with
     port 0 reserved for the console of each host and  ports  1-N
     corresponding  to  rlogin  pseudo-devices 1-N.  The per-user
     file, //sspprriittee//aaddmmiinn//llaassttLLoogg, has one record  per  registered
     user, indexed by the userID in //eettcc//ppaasssswwdd.

     When a user logs in, the record for the user's last login is
     updated  to show the new login.  The record for the host and
     port into which the user logs in is updated  with  the  same
     information.   When  the user logs out, the latter record is
     invalidated to show no one is currently logged  in  on  that
     port, but the record for last login is updated only when the
     user logs in again.

     Each record contains the following information, separated by
     white space:

     valid         Whether the entry  corresponds  to  a  current
                   login.

     hostID        Host on which user logged in.

     portID        Port on this host on which user logged in.

     time          time at which user logged in, or 0 when record
                   is invalidated.

     location      string indicating other host from which rlogin
                   occurred, or empty.

     Although the information is stored in ASCII format, to  make
     it  sharable  by  machines  with  different  byte orderings,
     internally the user log is accessed via routines  that  con-
     vert  between  ASCII  and an internal C structure.  Refer to
     the documentation for the uulloogg library for information about
     this structure.
