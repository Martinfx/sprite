     man - Ditroff macros for writing manual entries

_________________________________________________________________


IINNTTRROODDUUCCTTIIOONN
     Manual entries in Sprite are formatted with the ddiittrrooffff pro-
     gram  using  the  --mmaann macros.  This manual entry summarizes
     the features provided by the --mmaann macros.  For more  general
     information on how to write manual entries for Sprite, refer
     to _T_h_e  _S_p_r_i_t_e  _E_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g  _M_a_n_u_a_l.   Templates  of  manual
     entries for programs and library procedures are available in
     //sspprriittee//lliibb//ffoorrmmss//ccmmdd..mmaann   and    //sspprriittee//lliibb//ffoorrmmss//lliibb..mmaann
     respectively.


MMAACCRROOSS
     The --mmaann macros are:

     ..AAPP _t_y_p_e _n_a_m_e _i_n_O_u_t [_i_n_d_e_n_t]
          Argument paragraph.  The _t_y_p_e, _n_a_m_e,  and  _i_n_O_u_t  argu-
          ments  give information about this argument:  its type,
          its name, and a string indicating how the  argument  is
          used.  _I_n_O_u_t must be either iinn (meaning the argument is
          used by the procedure but is not used to modify  infor-
          mation  in the caller's memory), oouutt (meaning the argu-
          ment points to information in the caller's memory which
          the procedure modifies without ever reading), or iinn//oouutt
          (meaning the argument  points  to  information  in  the
          caller's  memory  which is both read and written by the
          procedure).  Text following the  ..AAPP  line  provides  a
          short  description of the argument: it will be indented
          to appear to the right of _t_y_p_e, _n_a_m_e,  and  _i_n_O_u_t.   If
          _i_n_d_e_n_t  is  specified, it determines the indentation of
          the following text in ens;  however, this  argument  is
          normally omitted, in which case a reasonable default is
          picked.  In a sequence of argument  descriptions,  each
          with  its  own  ..AAPP  call,  the  _t_y_p_e, _n_a_m_e, _i_n_O_u_t, and
          description parts will be lined up in columns.  The ..AASS
          macro may be used to size the columns.

     ..AASS _t_y_p_e _n_a_m_e
          Set argument sizes for ..AAPP.  _T_y_p_e and _n_a_m_e specify  the
          largest such arguments that will be used in a following
          series of ..AAPP calls;  tab stops are set for the follow-
          ing  calls  so that the _t_y_p_e and _n_a_m_e columns will line
          up with adequate  spacing.   If  this  macro  is  never
          invoked,  then  default  field  widths  will be chosen,
          which are valid for small arguments.

     ..BB [_a_r_g_s]

man                       File Formats                        man



          Print in boldface.  If any _a_r_g_s are given, then all  of
          the  arguments  are  printed  in boldface (up to six of
          them).  Otherwise, everything on the next line of input
          is  printed  in  boldface.   In  either  case, the font
          reverts to roman after the arguments or following  line
          have been printed.

     ..BBEE  End boxed text.  Close off  a  box  started  previously
          with ..BBSS.

     ..BBSS  Start boxed text.  Everything up to  the  matching  ..BBEE
          macro  will be enclosed in a box.  This is used for the
          summary boxes at the tops of manual entries.

     ..DDEE  End a display:  cancel the effects of the previous  ..DDSS
          macro, returning to normal indentation and fill mode.

     ..DDSS  Start a display.  All lines up until the next ..DDEE macro
          will be indented and output in no-fill mode.

     ..DDTT  Reset tabs to default spacings (every half-inch).

     ..IIPP _t_a_g [_i_n_d_e_n_t]
          This is identical to ..IIPP in the --mmss macros.  It  starts
          an  indented  paragraph  with ttaagg (if given) as an out-
          dented tag.  If _i_n_d_e_n_t is given, it specifies how  much
          the paragraph will be indented, in ens.

     ..HHPP  Start a paragraph with a hanging indent (the first line
          will  be  outdented  relative  to the rest of the para-
          graph).

     ..HHSS _s_e_c_t_i_o_n [_d_a_t_e [_v_e_r_s_i_o_n]]
          Header for Sprite.  This macro should be used in  place
          of ..TTHH for all Sprite manual entries.  It should be the
          first thing in the entry's source file.  _S_e_c_t_i_o_n  indi-
          cates  which  section  of the manual this entry belongs
          to, and should be one of:

          aaddmmiinn       The manual entry describes  an  administra-
                      tive  program  (i.e.  one  whose  binary is
                      under //sspprriittee//aaddmmiinn).  Administrative  pro-
                      grams are not used by normal users.

          ccmmddss        The manual  entry  describes  a  user-level
                      application   program.    This  section  is
                      equivalent to section 1 of UNIX manuals.

          ddaaeemmoonnss     The manual entry describes  a  daemon  pro-
                      gram.   Daemons  are  programs  that run in
                      background to provide various  system  ser-
                      vices,  such  as  iinneettdd  or  llppdd.  They are

                      normally invoked automatically at boot-time
                      or  when needed, and aren't usually visible
                      to ordinary users.

          ddeevv         The manual entry describes the characteris-
                      tics  of a particular type of I/O device or
                      pseudo-device, along with the I/O  controls
                      that  may  be  applied  to  devices of that
                      type.  This section is equivalent  to  sec-
                      tion 4 of UNIX manuals.

          ffiilleess       The manual entry describes the format of  a
                      particular file or file type.  For example,
                      the manual entry you are reading is in  the
                      ffiilleess  section.  This section is equivalent
                      to section 5 of UNIX manuals.

          lliibb         The manual entry describes one or more pro-
                      cedures in one of the standard C libraries.
                      This section is equivalent to the  combina-
                      tion of sections 2 and 3 of UNIX manuals.

          ttccll         The manual entry describes one or more pro-
                      cedures   from  the  Tcl  command  language
                      library.

          The _d_a_t_e argument to ..HHSS is optional and specifies  the
          date  on which the entry (or its corresponding program)
          was last modified.  The _v_e_r_s_i_o_n  argument  is  optional
          and  specifies  the Sprite version number corresponding
          to this version  of  the  manual  entry.   The  current
          default is ``1.0''.

     ..II [_a_r_g_s]
          Print in italics.  If any _a_r_g_s are given, then  all  of
          the  arguments  are  printed  in  italics (up to six of
          them).  Otherwise, everything on the next line of input
          is  printed  in  italics.   In  either  case,  the font
          reverts to roman after the arguments or following  line
          have been printed.

     ..LLGG [_a_r_g_s]
          Print in a larger font.  If any _a_r_g_s  are  given,  then
          all  of  the arguments are printed in a larger font (up
          to six of them).  Otherwise,  everything  on  the  next
          line  of  input is printed in a larger font.  In either
          case, the font reverts to normal size after  the  argu-
          ments or following line have been printed.

     ..LLPP  Start a new paragraph.  Same as ..PPPP.

     ..PPDD _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e



Sprite v.1.0            February 17, 1989                       3






man                       File Formats                        man



          Set the spacing between paragraphs to _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e.

     ..PPPP  Start a new paragraph.

     ..RREE [_l_e_v_e_l]
          End right-shifted text, moving  the  indentation  level
          back  to  its previous level.  Normally, each ..RRSS moves
          the indentation back one level (in the case  of  nested
          ..RRSS  calls).   However, if _l_e_v_e_l is specified, it gives
          the index of the nesting level from  which  to  return.
          For  example,  ..RRSS  33  says  to return from 3 levels of
          nesting to 2 levels (when this call is  invoked,  there
          better  be  at least three nested ..RRSS calls in effect).
          ..RRSS 00 says to return from all nested ..RRSS calls.

     ..RRSS [_i_n_d_e_n_t]
          Right shift.  From now on, indent all future  text  (up
          to  the  matching ..RREE) by an additional amount equal to
          _i_n_d_e_n_t ens.  If _i_n_d_e_n_t isn't specified,  then  use  the
          current  indentation  (from the last ..TTPP or ..IIPP) as the
          amount of additional indentation.  Pairs of ..RRSS and ..RREE
          calls  may be nested.  The ..SSHH macro cancels all active
          ..RRSS calls.

     ..SSHH _n_a_m_e [_m_o_r_e_N_a_m_e ...]
          Start a new section named _n_a_m_e.  The _n_a_m_e may  actually
          consist of up to six distinct arguments.

     ..SSSS _n_a_m_e [_m_o_r_e_N_a_m_e ... ]
          Start a new subsection named _n_a_m_e.  The _n_a_m_e may  actu-
          ally consist of up to six distinct arguments.

     ..SSMM [_a_r_g_s]
          Print in a smaller font.  If any _a_r_g_s are  given,  then
          all  of the arguments are printed in a smaller font (up
          to six of them).  Otherwise,  everything  on  the  next
          line  of input is printed in a smaller font.  In either
          case, the font reverts to normal size after  the  argu-
          ments or following line have been printed.

     ..TTHH _n_a_m_e _s_e_c_t_i_o_n [_d_a_t_e [_v_e_r_s_i_o_n]]
          Set title and heading.  This macro is obsolete.  It  is
          used  for  old  UNIX manual pages only.  For Sprite man
          pages, the ..HHSS macro  should  be  used  instead.   _N_a_m_e
          gives the name of the manual page, which will appear in
          the upper-right and upper-left corners  of  each  page.
          _S_e_c_t_i_o_n  gives  the  section  number.   _D_a_t_e  gives the
          last-modified-time for the program;  if not  specified,
          it defaults to blank.  _V_e_r_s_i_o_n gives the operating sys-
          tem version that this manual entry corresponds to.  The
          default  for  _v_e_r_s_i_o_n  varies in time;  see the ttmmaacc..aann
          source file for the current value.

     ..TTPP [_i_n_d_e_n_t]
          Start a tagged paragraph.  The following line  contains
          a  tag, and everything after that contains the contents
          of the paragraph.  The tag will be printed outdented to
          the  normal  left  margin,  and  the  paragraph will be
          indented relative to the tag.  If _i_n_d_e_n_t is  specified,
          then  the indent distance is changed to _i_n_d_e_n_t ens (the
          indent distance is sticky across calls to ..TTPP  and  ..IIPP
          but gets reset to a default value by ..PPPP and ..SSHH).  For
          example, each of the macro descriptions in this partic-
          ular manual entry was formatted using the ..TTPP macro.

     ..VVEE  End vertical sidebar.  Starting with  the  output  line
          following  the current one, do not print vertical side-
          bars.

     ..VVSS  Start vertical sidebar.  From now on, starting with the
          current  output line, a vertical bar will appear at the
          right side of all output  lines.   This  will  continue
          until  the  next  ..VVEE call.  Sidebars should be used to
          indicate recent changes in the manual entry.
