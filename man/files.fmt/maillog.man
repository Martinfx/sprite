     This document describes the Sprite  log,  a  repository  for
     sprite-related mail.  Mail sent to sspprriittee--lloogg will be stored
     in a directory in the  sprite  account,  ~sprite/Log.   Each
     message is stored in its own file.

     The lloogg subdirectory of the Sprite log contains the messages
     themselves,  which  are  numbered  sequentially.   The iinnddeexx
     subdirectory contains information to help  users  find  mes-
     sages  in the log.  Each time a message is added to the log,
     its log entry number, originator, date sent, size, and  sub-
     ject  line  are recorded in a number of files.  Each message
     is entered in cchhrroonn, which is a chronlogically-ordered list-
     ing of all messages in the log.  In addition, the message is
     entered in ffrroomm-_u_s_e_r, where _u_s_e_r is the  account  that  sent
     the message.

     Finally,  the  message  is  entered  in  files  with   names
     corresponding  to  the keywords associated with the message.
     If the message contains a KKeeyywwoorrddss:: line, the words on  that
     line  are  taken  to be keywords; otherwise, the non-trivial
     words in the subject line are used.   Punctuation  and  case
     are ignored.  Typical keywords include ``bug'', ``fix'', and
     the names of kernel modules, libraries, and programs.

     As an example, consider a message sent from douglis  to  the
     Sprite  log  with  the subject ``bug: fs recovery''.  If the
     next message in the log were 00143, then the message  itself
     would be stored in ~sprite/Log/log/00143, and a line like

     00143 douglis Mon Sep 14 12:01:14 1987   13 bug: fs recovery

     would be written to the files cchhrroonn, ffrroomm--ddoouugglliiss, bbuugg,  ffss,
     and rreeccoovveerryy in ~sprite/Log/index.

     Note: the Sprite log is currently stored under Unix.
