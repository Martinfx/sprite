     pprrooffiill(()) enables run-time execution profiling, and reserves
     a buffer for maintaining raw profiling statistics.  _b_u_f_f
     points to an area of core of length _b_u_f_s_i_z (in bytes).
     After the call to pprrooffiill, the user's program counter (pc) is
     examined at each clock tick (10 milliseconds on Sun-4 sys-
     tems, 20 milliseconds on Sun-2 and Sun-3 systems); _o_f_f_s_e_t is
     subtracted from its value, and the result multiplied by
     _s_c_a_l_e.  If the resulting number corresponds to a word within
     the buffer, that word is incremented.

     _s_c_a_l_e is interpreted as an unsigned, fixed-point fraction
     with binary point at the left: 0x10000 gives a 1-to-1 map-
     ping of pc values to words in _b_u_f_f; 0x8000 maps each pair of
     instruction words together.  0x2 maps all instructions onto
     the beginning of _b_u_f_f (producing a non-interrupting core
     clock).

     Profiling is turned off by giving a _s_c_a_l_e of 0 or 1.  It is
     rendered ineffective by giving a _b_u_f_s_i_z of 0.  Profiling is
     turned off when an eexxeeccvvee(()) is executed, but remains on in
     child and parent both after a ffoorrkk(()).  Profiling is turned
     off if an update in _b_u_f_f would cause a memory fault.
