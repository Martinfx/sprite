     _S_t_r_t_o_k is used to isolate sequential tokens in a null-
     terminated string, _s_t_r.  These tokens are separated in the
     string by oonnee oorr mmoorree of the characters in _s_e_p.  The first
     time that _s_t_r_t_o_k is called, _s_t_r should be specified; subse-
     quent calls, wishing to obtain further tokens from the same
     string, should pass a null pointer instead.  The separator
     string, _s_e_p, must be supplied each time, and may change
     between calls.  _S_t_r_t_o_k returns a pointer to the start of
     each subsequent token in the string, after replacing the
     token itself with a NUL character.  When no more tokens
     remain, a null pointer is returned.

     _S_t_r_s_e_p behaves similarly to _s_t_r_t_o_k with the exception that
     the tokens in the string are separated by single occurrences
     of separator characters.  This routine was added to allow
     handling blank fields.

BBUUGGSS
     There is no way to get tokens from multiple strings simul-
     taneously.
