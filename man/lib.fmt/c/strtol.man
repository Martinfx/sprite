     The ssttrrttooll and ssttrrttoouull procedures convert a character string
     to  its  corresponding integer representation and return the
     integer value.  Both procedures expect _s_t_r_i_n_g to point to  a
     sequence  of  digits,  optionally  preceded by any amount of
     white space (as defined by the iissssppaaccee  procedure).   SSttrrttooll
     also  permits  the  digits  to  be preceded immediately by a
     minus sign, in which case the result is a negative integer.

     If _b_a_s_e is between 2 and 36, inclusive, then the permissible
     ``digits''  of  the string consist of the first _b_a_s_e charac-
     ters in the set 00 through 99 and aa through zz  (or  AA  through
     ZZ).  The integer result will be calculated using _b_a_s_e as the
     radix for conversion.  If the value of _b_a_s_e is 16, then  the
     characters  00xx  or  00XX may precede the digits, following the
     sign if it is present.

     If _b_a_s_e is 0, then the radix for conversion is chosen  based
     on  the initial digits of the number.  If the initial digits
     are 00xx or 00XX, then base 16  will  be  used  for  conversion;
     otherwise  if  the first digit is 00 then base 8 will be used
     for conversion; otherwise base 10 will be used.

     SSttrrttooll and ssttrrttoouull convert as many  characters  as  possible

     from  _s_t_r_i_n_g, and return in *_e_n_d_P_t_r the address of the first
     character not forming a valid portion of the number.  If  no
     conversion  could be performed (_s_t_r_i_n_g was empty, or did not
     point to a number in the expected form), then _s_t_r_i_n_g will be
     stored in *_e_n_d_P_t_r and zero is returned.
