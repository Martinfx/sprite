     The system call returns the shared memory identifier associ-
     ated with _k_e_y.

     A shared memory identifier and associated data structure and
     shared memory segment of size _s_i_z_e bytes are created for _k_e_y
     if one of the following are true:

             The _k_e_y is equal to IPC_PRIVATE.  For further infor-
             mation, see intro(2).

             The _k_e_y does not already have a shared memory iden-
             tifier associated with it, and (_s_h_m_f_l_g & IPC_CREAT )
             is "true".

     Upon creation, the data structure associated with the new
     shared memory identifier is initialized as follows:

             The sshhmm__ppeerrmm..ccuuiidd,,shm_perm.uid,sshhmm__ppeerrmm..ccggiidd,, and
             sshhmm__ppeerrmm..ggiidd are set equal to the effective user ID
             and effective group ID, respectively, of the calling
             process.

             The low-order 9 bits of sshhmm__ppeerrmm..mmooddee are set equal
             to the low-order 9 bits of _s_h_m_f_l_g. The sshhmm__sseeggsszz is
             set equal to the value of _s_i_z_e.

             The sshhmm__llppiidd,,shm_nattch,sshhmm__aattiimmee,, and sshhmm__ddttiimmee are
             set equal to 0.  The sshhmm__ccttiimmee is set equal to the
             current time.

     Upon successful completion, a non-negative integer, namely a
     shared memory identifier is returned.  Otherwise, a value of
     -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicated the error.
