     ttrruunnccaattee(()) causes the file referred to by _p_a_t_h (or for
     ffttrruunnccaattee(()) the object referred to by _f_d) to have a size
     equal to _l_e_n_g_t_h bytes.  If the file was previously longer
     than _l_e_n_g_t_h, the extra bytes are removed from the file.  If
     it was shorter, bytes between the old and new lengths are
     read as zeroes.  With ffttrruunnccaattee(()), the file must be open for
     writing.
