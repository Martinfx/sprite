     _S_i_g_n_a_l is a simplified interface to the more general
     _s_i_g_v_e_c(2) facility.  See the _s_i_g_v_e_c(_2) manual entry for com-
     plete details on how signals are handled.

     If _f_u_n_c is SIG_DFL, the default action for signal _s_i_g is
     reinstated.  If _f_u_n_c is SIG_IGN the signal is subsequently
     ignored and pending instances of the signal are discarded.
     Otherwise, when the signal occurs further occurrences of the
     signal are automatically blocked and _f_u_n_c is called.

     A return from the function unblocks the handled signal and
     continues the process at the point it was interrupted.

     If a caught signal occurs during certain system calls, caus-
     ing the call to terminate prematurely, the call is automati-
     cally restarted.  In particular this can occur during a _r_e_a_d
     or _w_r_i_t_e(2) on a slow device (such as a terminal; but not a
     file) and during a _w_a_i_t(2).

     The value of _s_i_g_n_a_l is the previous (or initial) value of
     _f_u_n_c for the particular signal.

     After a _f_o_r_k(2) or _v_f_o_r_k(2) the child inherits all signals.
     _E_x_e_c_v_e(2) resets all caught signals to the default action;
     ignored signals remain ignored.

     The previous action is returned on a successful call.  Oth-
     erwise, -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the
     error.

     _S_i_g_n_a_l will fail and no action will take place if one of the
     following occur:

     [EINVAL]       _S_i_g is not a valid signal number.

     [EINVAL]       An attempt is made to ignore or supply a
                    handler for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP.

     [EINVAL]       An attempt is made to ignore SIGCONT (by
                    default SIGCONT is ignored).
