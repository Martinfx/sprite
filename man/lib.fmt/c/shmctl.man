     The system call provides a variety of shared memory control
     operations as specified by _c_m_d. The following _c_m_d_s are
     available:

     IIPPCC__SSTTAATT       Place the current value of each member of the
                    data structure associated with _s_h_m_i_d into the
                    structure pointed to by _b_u_f.  The contents of
                    this structure are defined in

     IIPPCC__SSEETT        Set the value of the following members of the
                    data structure associated with _s_h_m_i_d to the
                    corresponding value found in the structure
                    pointed to by _b_u_f: shm_perm.uid shm_perm.gid
                    shm_perm.mode    /* only low 9 bits */

             This _c_m_d can only be executed by a process that has
             an effective user ID equal to either that of super
             user or to the value of sshhmm__ppeerrmm..uuiidd in the data
             structure associated with _s_h_m_i_d.

     IIPPCC__RRMMIIDD       Remove the shared memory identifier specified
                    by _s_h_m_i_d from the system and destroy the
                    shared memory segment and data structure
                    associated with it. This _c_m_d can only be exe-
                    cuted by a process that has an effective user
                    ID equal to either that of super user or to
                    the value of sshhmm__ppeerrmm..uuiidd in the data struc-
                    ture associated with _s_h_m_i_d.

     SSHHMM__LLOOCCKK       Lock the shared memory segment specified by
                    _s_h_m_i_d in memory.  This _c_m_d can only be exe-
                    cuted by a process that has an effective usr
                    ID equal to super user.

     SSHHMM__UUNNLLOOCCKK     Unlock the shared memory segment specified by
                    _s_h_m_i_d. This _c_m_d can only be executed by a
                    process that has an effective usr ID equal to
                    super user.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-

     The system call will fail if one or more of the following
     are true:

     [EINVAL]       The _s_h_m_i_d is not a valid shared memory iden-
                    tifier.

     [EINVAL]       The _c_m_d is not a valid command.

     [EACCES]       The _c_m_d is equal to IPC_STAT and read permis-
                    sion is denied to the calling process.  For
                    further information, see

     [EPERM]        The _c_m_d is equal to IPC_RMID or IPC_SET and
                    the effective user ID of the calling process
                    is not equal to that of super user and it is
                    not equal to the value of sshhmm__ppeerrmm..uuiidd in the
                    data structure associated with _s_h_m_i_d.

     [EPERM]        The _c_m_d is equal to SHM_LOCK or SHM_UNLOCK
                    and the effective user ID of the calling pro-
                    cess is not equal to that of superuser.

     [EINVAL]       The _c_m_d is equal to SHM_LOCK and the shared
                    memory segment is currently locked by this
                    process.

     [EINVAL]       The _c_m_d is equal to SHM_UNLOCK and the shared
                    memory segment specified by _s_h_m_i_d is not
                    currently locked in memory by this process.

     [EFAULT]       The _b_u_f points to an illegal address.

     The System V shared memory functions are implemented at user
     level on top of the mmap(2) interface.  Not all the System V
     functionality is implemented.
