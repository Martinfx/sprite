     The file whose name is given by _p_a_t_h has its type changed to
     _t_y_p_e.  Types are defined in <_f_s._h>.
          FS_USER_TYPE_UNDEFINED  0   no type set
          FS_USER_TYPE_TMP        1   temporary file
          FS_USER_TYPE_SWAP       2   swap file
          FS_USER_TYPE_OBJECT     3   object file
          FS_USER_TYPE_BINARY     4   executable
          FS_USER_TYPE_OTHER      5   file that doesn't correspond to any specific type

     The advisory file type is used by the system for statistics
     gathering.  At some point in the future, it may be used for
     performance enhancements as well: for example,  varying the
     amount of time allowed before flushing a file to disk,
     depending on the importance of not losing data from it.

     Only the owner of a file (or the super-user) may change its
     type.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
     erwise, a value of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indi-
     cate the error.

     _S_e_t_f_i_l_e_t_y_p_e will fail and the file type will be unchanged
     if:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a
                    directory.

     [EINVAL]       The pathname contains a character with the
                    high-order bit set.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeded 255 char-
                    acters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
                    characters.

     [ENOENT]       The named file does not exist.

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for a component
                    of the path prefix.

     [EPERM]        The effective user ID does not match the
                    owner of the file and the effective user ID
                    is not the super-user.

     [EROFS]        The named file resides on a read-only file
                    system.

     [EFAULT]       _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from or
                    writing to the file system.
