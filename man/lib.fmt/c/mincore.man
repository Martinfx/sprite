     _M_i_n_c_o_r_e checks pages to see if they are in physical memory
     and returns their state.

     For each page in the address range starting at address _a_d_d_r
     and extending for _l_e_n bytes, a residency value is returned
     in the return vector _v_e_c.

     The user must have allocated enough space in *_v_e_c to hold
     the result vector.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
     The values are returned in the vector vec.  0 indicates the
     page is not virtually present (i.e. is an invalid address).
     1 indicates the page is paged out.  2 indicates the page is
     clean and unreferenced.  3 indicates the page is clean and
     referenced.  4 indicates the page is dirty.

BBUUGGSS
     This command is machine-dependent.  In particular, some
     machines may not be able to determine if a page has been
     referenced.
