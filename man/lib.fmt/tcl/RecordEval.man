                                       the command is not exe-
                                       cuted;  it's just
                                       recorded.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall is invoked to record a command on the his-
     tory list and then execute it.  Programs that do not wish to
     use the history mechanism should not call TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall;
     they should call TTccll__EEvvaall instead.  Furthermore,
     TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall should only be called with top-level com-
     mands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to
     allow the user to re-issue recently-invoked commands.

     This procedure does three things.  First, it initializes
     history for the interpreter _i_n_t_e_r_p, if this is the first
     call for _i_n_t_e_r_p.  Among other things, this makes the hhiissttoorryy
     command available in _i_n_t_e_r_p.  If TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall isn't
     called for an interpreter then there will be no hhiissttoorryy com-
     mand in that interpreter.  Second, TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall saves
     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in the history list for iinntteerrpp, making a new event
     to hold the command.  Third, TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall executes the
     command by passing it and _f_l_a_g_s to TTccll__EEvvaall.  If _f_l_a_g_s is -1
     then only the first two steps are taken;  the command will
     not be executed.
