     Tcl includes a library of Tcl procedures for commonly-needed  |
     functions.   The  procedures  defined in the Tcl library are  |
     generic ones suitable for use  by  many  different  applica-  |
     tions.   The  location of the Tcl library is returned by the  |
     iinnffoo lliibbrraarryy command.  In addition to the Tcl library,  each  |
     application  will  normally  have its own library of support  |
     procedures as well;  the location of this  library  is  nor-  |
     mally given by the value of the $$aappppLLiibbrraarryy global variable.  |

     To access the procedures in the Tcl library, an  application  |
     should  source the file iinniitt..ttccll in the library, for example  |
     with the Tcl command                                          |

          ssoouurrccee [[iinnffoo lliibbrraarryy]]//iinniitt..ttccll                           |
     This will define the uunnkknnoowwnn procedure and arrange  for  the  |
     other  procedures to be loaded on-demand using the auto-load  |
     mechanism defined below.                                      |


CCOOMMMMAANNDD PPRROOCCEEDDUURREESS                                                 |
     The following procedures are provided in the Tcl library:     |

     aauuttoo__eexxeeccookk _c_m_d                                                    ||
          Determines  whether  there is an executable file by the  |
          name _c_m_d.  This command examines the directories in the  |
          current  search  path  (given  by  the PATH enviornment  |
          variable) to see if there is an executable  file  named  |
          _c_m_d  in any of those directories.  If so, it returns 1;  |
          if not it returns 0.  AAuuttoo__eexxeecc  remembers  information  |
          about  previous  searches in an array named aauuttoo__eexxeeccss;  |
          this avoids the path search in  future  calls  for  the  |
          same  _c_m_d.  The command aauuttoo__rreesseett may be used to force  |
          aauuttoo__eexxeeccookk to forget its cached information.            |

     aauuttoo__llooaadd _c_m_d                                                      ||
          This  command attempts to load the definition for a Tcl  |
          procedure named _c_m_d.  To do this, it searches an  _a_u_t_o-  |

          _l_o_a_d  _p_a_t_h, which is a list of one or more directories.  |
          The auto-load path is  given  by  the  global  variable  |
          $$aauuttoo__ppaatthh  if  it  exists.   If there is no $$aauuttoo__ppaatthh  |
          variable, then the TCLLIBPATH environment  variable  is  |
          used,  if it exists.  Otherwise the auto-load path con-  |
          sists of just the Tcl library directory.   Within  each  |
          directory  in  the  auto-load path there must be a file  |
          ttccllIInnddeexx that describes the procedures defined in  that  |
          directory  and  the  file  in  which  each procedure is  |
          defined.  The ttccllIInnddeexx file should  be  generated  with  |
          the  aauuttoo__mmkkiinnddeexx command.  If _c_m_d is found in an index  |
          file, then the appropriate script is ssoouurrcceed to  create  |
          the  procedure.  The aauuttoo__llooaadd command returns 1 if the  |
          script was successfully sourced  and  _c_m_d  now  exists.  |
          The  command  returns 0 if there was no index entry for  |
          _c_m_d or if the script didn't actually define  _c_m_d  (e.g.  |
          because index information is out of date).  If an error  |
          occurs while processing the script, then that error  is  |
          returned.   AAuuttoo__llooaadd  only reads the index information  |
          once and saves it  in  the  array  aauuttoo__iinnddeexx;   future  |
          calls  to  aauuttoo__llooaadd  check for _c_m_d in the array rather  |
          than re-reading the  index  files.   The  cached  index  |
          information may be deleted with the command aauuttoo__rreesseett.  |
          This will force the next aauuttoo__llooaadd  command  to  reload  |
          the index database from disk.                            |

     aauuttoo__mmkkiinnddeexx _d_i_r _p_a_t_t_e_r_n                                           ||
          Generates  an index suitable for use by aauuttoo__llooaadd.  The  |
          command searches _d_i_r for all files  whose  names  match  |
          _p_a_t_t_e_r_n  (matching is done with the gglloobb command), gen-  |
          erates an index  of  all  the  Tcl  command  procedures  |
          defined in all the matching files, and stores the index  |
          information in a file named ttccllIInnddeexx in _d_i_r.  For exam-  |
          ple, the command                                         |

               aauuttoo__mmkkiinnddeexx ffoooo **..ttccll                              |

          will read all the ..ttccll files in  subdirectory  ffoooo  and  |
          generate a new index file ffoooo//ttccllIInnddeexx.                  |

          AAuuttoo__mmkkiinnddeexx parses the Tcl  scripts  in  a  relatively  |
          unsophisticated  way:   if  any  line contains the word  |
          pprroocc as its first characters then it is assumed to be a  |
          procedure  definition  and the next word of the line is  |
          taken as the procedure's name.   Procedure  definitions  |
          that  don't  appear  in this way (e.g. they have spaces  |
          before the pprroocc) will not be indexed.                    |

     aauuttoo__rreesseett                                                         ||
          Destroys  all the information cached by aauuttoo__eexxeeccookk and  |
          aauuttoo__llooaadd.  This information will be re-read from  disk  |
          the next time it is needed.                              |

          Prints  on  standard output the names and values of all  |
          the elements in the array _a_r_r_a_y_N_a_m_e.  AArrrraayyNNaammee must be  |

          This  procedure  is  invoked  automatically  by the Tcl  |
          interpreter whenever the  name  of  a  command  doesn't  |
          exist.  The uunnkknnoowwnn procedure receives as its arguments  |
          the name and arguments of the missing command.  UUnnkknnoowwnn  |
          first  calls aauuttoo__llooaadd to load a procedure for the com-  |
          mand.  If this succeeds, then it executes the  original  |
          command  with its original arguments.  If the auto-load  |
          fails then uunnkknnoowwnn calls aauuttoo__eexxeeccookk to see if there is  |
          an  executable file by the name _c_m_d.  If so, it invokes  |
          the Tcl eexxeecc command with _c_m_d and all the _a_r_g_s as argu-  |
          ments.   If  _c_m_d can't be auto-executed, uunnkknnoowwnn checks  |
          to see if _c_m_d is a unique abbreviation for an  existing  |
          Tcl  command.   If  so, it expands the command name and  |
          executes  the  command  with  the  original  arguments.  |
          Finally,  if none of the above efforts has been able to  |
          execute the command, uunnkknnoowwnn generates an error return.  |
          If the global variable aauuttoo__nnoollooaadd is defined, then the  |
          auto-load step is  skipped.   If  the  global  variable  |
          aauuttoo__nnooeexxeecc  is  defined  then  the  auto-exec  step is  |
          skipped.  Under normal circumstances the  return  value  |
          from  uunnkknnoowwnn is the return value from the command that  |
          was eventually executed.                                 |
