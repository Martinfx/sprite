     TTccll__CCoonnccaatt is a utility procedure used by several of the Tcl
     commands.   Given  a  collection of strings, it concatenates
     them together  into  a  single  string,  with  the  original
     strings  separated  by  spaces.  This procedure behaves dif-
     ferently than TTccll__MMeerrggee, in that the  arguments  are  simply
     concatenated: no effort is made to ensure proper list struc-
     ture.  However, in most common usage the arguments will  all  |
     be  proper  lists  themselves;   if  this  is true, then the  |
     result will also have proper list structure.                  |

     TTccll__CCoonnccaatt eliminates leading and trailing white space as it  |
     copies  strings  from  aarrggvv to the result.  If an element of  |
     aarrggvv consists of nothing but white space, then  that  string  |
     is  ignored entirely.  This white-space removal was added to  |
     make the output of the ccoonnccaatt command cleaner-looking.

     The result string is dynamically allocated  using  mmaalllloocc(());
     the  caller  must  eventually  release  the space by calling
     ffrreeee(()).
