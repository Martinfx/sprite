     This utility  procedure  does  tilde  substition.   If  _n_a_m_e
     doesn't  start  with  a  ``~'' character, then the procedure
     returns _n_a_m_e.   If  _n_a_m_e  does  start  with  a  tilde,  then
     TTccll__TTiillddeeSSuubbsstt returns a new string identical to _n_a_m_e except
     that the first element of _n_a_m_e is replaced with the location
     of  the home directory for the given user.  The substitution
     is carried out in the same way that it would be done by _c_s_h.
     If  the  tilde  is followed immediately by a slash, then the
     $$HHOOMMEE environment variable is  substituted.   Otherwise  the
     characters between the tilde and the next slash are taken as
     a user name, which is looked up in the password  file;   the
     user's  home  directory  is retrieved from the password file
     and substituted.

     The string returned by TTccll__TTiillddeeSSuubbsstt  is  a  static  string
     belonging  to  TTccll__TTiillddeeSSuubbsstt.   Its value will only persist
     until the next call to TTccll__TTiillddeeSSuubbsstt;   the  caller  should
     make a copy of the result if it needs to live a long time.

     If an error occurs (e.g. because there was no  user  by  the
     given  name) then NULL is returned and an error message will
     be left at  _i_n_t_e_r_p->_r_e_s_u_l_t.   It  is  assumed  that  _i_n_t_e_r_p-
     >_r_e_s_u_l_t  has  been  initialized  in  the  standard  way when
     TTccll__TTiillddeeSSuubbsstt is invoked.
