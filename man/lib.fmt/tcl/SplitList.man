     These procedures may be used to disassemble  and  reassemble
     Tcl  lists.  TTccll__SSpplliittLLiisstt breaks a list up into its consti-
     tuent elements, returning an array of pointers to  the  ele-
     ments using _a_r_g_c_P_t_r and _a_r_g_v_P_t_r.  While extracting the argu-
     ments, TTccll__SSpplliittLLiisstt obeys the  usual  rules  for  backslash
     substitutions  and braces.  The area of memory pointed to by
     *_a_r_g_v_P_t_r is dynamically allocated;  in addition to the array
     of  pointers, it also holds copies of all the list elements.
     It is the caller's responsibility to free  up  all  of  this
     storage by calling

          ffrreeee((char *) *_a_r_g_v_P_t_r)
     when the list elements are no longer needed.

     TTccll__SSpplliittLLiisstt normally returns TTCCLL__OOKK, which means the  list
     was  successfully  parsed.   If  there was a syntax error in
     _l_i_s_t, then TTCCLL__EERRRROORR is  returned  and  _i_n_t_e_r_p->_r_e_s_u_l_t  will
     point  to  an  error  message  describing  the  problem.  If
     TTCCLL__EERRRROORR is  returned  then  no  memory  is  allocated  and
     *_a_r_g_v_P_t_r is not modified.

     TTccll__MMeerrggee is the inverse of TTccll__SSpplliittLLiisstt:  it takes a  col-
     lection  of  strings  given by _a_r_g_c and _a_r_g_v and generates a
     result string that has proper list  structure.   This  means
     that commands like iinnddeexx may be used to extract the original

     elements again.  In addition, if the result of TTccll__MMeerrggee  is
     passed  to TTccll__EEvvaall, it will be parsed into _a_r_g_c words whose
     values will be the  same  as  the  _a_r_g_v  strings  passed  to
     TTccll__MMeerrggee.   TTccll__MMeerrggee  will  modify  the list elements with
     braces and/or backslashes in order  to  produce  proper  Tcl
     list  structure.  The result string is dynamically allocated
     using mmaalllloocc(());  the  caller  must  eventually  release  the
     space using ffrreeee(()).

     If the result of TTccll__MMeerrggee is passed to  TTccll__SSpplliittLLiisstt,  the
     elements  returned  by  TTccll__SSpplliittLLiisstt  will  be identical to
     those passed into TTccll__MMeerrggee.  However, the converse  is  not
     true:   if  TTccll__SSpplliittLLiisstt  is passed a given string, and the
     resulting _a_r_g_c and _a_r_g_v are passed to TTccll__MMeerrggee, the result-
     ing string may not be the same as the original string passed
     to  TTccll__SSpplliittLLiisstt.   This  is  because  TTccll__MMeerrggee  may   use
     backslashes and braces differently than the original string.

     TTccll__SSccaannEElleemmeenntt and TTccll__CCoonnvveerrttEElleemmeenntt  are  the  procedures  |
     that  do all of the real work of TTccll__MMeerrggee.  TTccll__SSccaannEElleemmeenntt  |
     scans its _s_r_c argument and determines how to use backslashes  |
     and braces when converting it to a list element.  It returns  |
     an overestimate of the  number  of  characters  required  to  |
     represent  _s_r_c  as a list element, and it stores information  |
     in *_f_l_a_g_s_P_t_r that is needed by TTccll__CCoonnvveerrttEElleemmeenntt.            |

     TTccll__CCoonnvveerrttEElleemmeenntt   is    a    companion    procedure    to  |
     TTccll__SSccaannEElleemmeenntt.   It  does  the actual work of converting a  |
     string to a list element.  Its _f_l_a_g_s argument  must  be  the  |
     same    as    the   value   returned   by   TTccll__SSccaannEElleemmeenntt.  |
     TTccll__CCoonnvveerrttEElleemmeenntt writes a proper list  element  to  memory  |
     starting  at *_d_s_t and returns a count of the total number of  |
     characters written, which will be no more  than  the  result  |
     returned  by TTccll__SSccaannEElleemmeenntt.  TTccll__CCoonnvveerrttEElleemmeenntt writes out  |
     only the actual list element without any leading or trailing  |
     spaces:  it  is  up  to the caller to include spaces between  |
     adjacent list elements.                                       |

     TTccll__CCoonnvveerrttEElleemmeenntt uses one of two different  approaches  to  |
     handle the special characters in _s_r_c.  Wherever possible, it  |
     handles special characters by surrounding  the  string  with  |
     braces.   This  produces  clean-looking output, but can't be  |
     used in some situations, such as when _s_r_c contains unmatched  |
     braces.   In  these  situations,  TTccll__CCoonnvveerrttEElleemmeenntt handles  |
     special characters by  generating  backslash  sequences  for  |
     them.   The  caller may insist on the second approach by OR-  |
     ing  the  flag  value  returned  by   TTccll__SSccaannEElleemmeenntt   with  |
     TTCCLL__DDOONNTT__UUSSEE__BBRRAACCEESS.   Although  this will produce an uglier  |
     result, it is useful in some  special  situations,  such  as  |
     when  TTccll__CCoonnvveerrttEElleemmeenntt is being used to generate a portion  |
     of an argument for a Tcl command.  In this case, surrounding  |
     _s_r_c  with  curly  braces  would  cause the command not to be  |
