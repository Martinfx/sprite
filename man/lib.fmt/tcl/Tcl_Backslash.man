     This is a utility procedure used by several of the Tcl  com-
     mands.   It parses a backslash sequence and returns the sin-
     gle character corresponding to the sequence.   TTccll__BBaacckkssllaasshh
     modifies  *_c_o_u_n_t_P_t_r  to  contain the number of characters in
     the backslash sequence.  If _s_r_c doesn't point to a backslash
     sequence  understood  by  Tcl,  then Tcl_Backslash returns a
     backslash as its result and *_c_o_u_n_t_P_t_r gets set to 1 (in this
     case  the  backslash  character  should  not get any special
     treatment).

     See the Tcl  manual  entry  for  information  on  the  valid
     backslash  sequences.  All of the sequences described in the
     Tcl manual  entry  are  supported  by  TTccll__BBaacckkssllaasshh  except  |
     backslash-newline, which is not understood.
