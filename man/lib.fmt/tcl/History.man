     The procedure TTccll__HHiissttoorryyIInniitt is invoked to enable the  his-  |
     tory  facilities  in  an interpreter (by default there is no  |
     hhiissttoorryy command in an interpreter).  After this command  has  |
     been  executed  the  hhiissttoorryy  command  will  be available in  |
     _i_n_t_e_r_p and  the  history  facilities  will  be  initialized.  |
     TTccll__HHiissttoorryyIInniitt      is     invoked     automatically     by  |
     TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall, so it  need  not  be  invoked  explicitly  |
     unless   the   hhiissttoorryy   command   is   to  be  used  before  |
     TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall has been called.

     TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall is invoked to record a command on the his-
     tory list and then execute it.  Programs that do not wish to
     use the history mechanism should not call TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall;
     they    should    call   TTccll__EEvvaall   instead.    Furthermore,
     TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall should only be called with top-level  com-
     mands  typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to
     allow the user to re-issue recently-invoked commands.

     TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall  does  three  things.   First,  it   calls
     TTccll__HHiissttoorryyIInniitt  to  initialize  history for the interpreter
     _i_n_t_e_r_p,  if  this  hasn't  already   been   done.    Second,

     TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall  saves  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  in  the  history list for
     _i_n_t_e_r_p, making a new event  to  hold  the  command.   Third,
     TTccll__RReeccoorrddAAnnddEEvvaall  executes  the  command  by passing it and
     _f_l_a_g_s to TTccll__EEvvaall.  If _f_l_a_g_s is -1 then only the  first  two
     steps are taken;  the command will not be executed.
