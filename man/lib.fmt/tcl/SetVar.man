     These procedures may be used to create,  modify,  read,  and  |
     delete   Tcl   variables   from   C  code.   TTccll__SSeettVVaarr  and  |
     TTccll__SSeettVVaarr22 will create a new variable or modify an existing  |
     one.  Both of these procedures set the given variable to the  |
     value given by _n_e_w_V_a_l_u_e, and they return a pointer to a copy  |
     of  the variable's new value, which is stored in Tcl's vari-  |
     able structure.  Tcl keeps a private copy of the  variable's  |
     value,  so  the  caller may change _n_e_w_V_a_l_u_e after these pro-  |
     cedures return without affecting the value of the  variable.  |
     If  an  error  occurs in setting the variable (e.g. an array  |
     variable is referenced without  giving  an  index  into  the  |
     array), then NULL is returned.                                |

     The name of the variable may be specified in either  of  two  |
     ways.   If  TTccll__SSeettVVaarr is called, the variable name is given  |
     as a single string, _v_a_r_N_a_m_e.  If _v_a_r_N_a_m_e  contains  an  open  |
     parenthesis  and  ends  with  a  close parenthesis, then the  |
     value between the parentheses is treated as an index  (which  |
     can  have  any  string  value) and the characters before the  |
     first open parenthesis are treated as the name of  an  array  |
     variable.   If _v_a_r_N_a_m_e doesn't have parentheses as described  |
     above, then the entire string is treated as the  name  of  a  |
     scalar  variable.   If TTccll__SSeettVVaarr22 is called, then the array  |
     name and index have been separated by the  caller  into  two  |
     separate strings, _n_a_m_e_1 and _n_a_m_e_2 respectively;  if _n_a_m_e_2 is  |
     zero it means that a scalar variable is being referenced.     |

     The _f_l_a_g_s argument may be used to  specify  any  of  several  |
     options to the procedures.  It consists of an OR-ed combina-  |
     tion of any of the following bits:                            |

     TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY                                                    ||
          Under normal circumstances the procedures look up vari-  |
          ables at  the  current  level  of  procedure  call  for  |
          _i_n_t_e_r_p,  or at global level if there is no call active.  |
          However, if this bit is set in _f_l_a_g_s then the  variable  |
          is  looked  up  at global level even if there is a pro-  |
          cedure call active.                                      |

     TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG                                                  ||
          If  an  error is returned and this bit is set in _f_l_a_g_s,  |
          then an error message will be left  in  _i_n_t_e_r_p->_r_e_s_u_l_t.  |
          If  this  flag  bit  isn't set then no error message is  |

          left (_i_n_t_e_r_p->_r_e_s_u_l_t will not be modified).              |

     TCL_APPEND_VALUE                                                   ||
          If  this  bit  is  set then _n_e_w_V_a_l_u_e is appended to the  |
          current value, instead of replacing it.  If  the  vari-  |
          able is currently undefined, then this bit is ignored.   |

     TCL_LIST_ELEMENT                                                   ||
          If  this  bit  is  set, then _n_e_w_V_a_l_u_e is converted to a  |
          valid Tcl list element before setting (or appending to)  |
          the variable.  If the list element is being appended to  |
          an non-empty value, then a space character is  appended  |
          before  the new list element to separate it from previ-  |
          ous elements.                                            |

     TCL_NO_SPACE                                                       ||
          If  this  bit  is  set,  it  prevents  the  output of a  |
          separating space character in TCL_LIST_ELEMENT appends.  |
          This  bit  has  no  effect  if the TCL_LIST_ELEMENT bit  |
          isn't set.                                               |

     TTccll__GGeettVVaarr and TTccll__GGeettVVaarr22 return the  current  value  of  a  |
     variable.   The arguments to these procedures are treated in  |
     the same way as the arguments to TTccll__SSeettVVaarr and TTccll__SSeettVVaarr22.  |
     Under normal circumstances, the return value is a pointer to  |
     the variable's value (which  is  stored  in  Tcl's  variable  |
     structure  and  will  not  change  before  the  next call to  |
     TTccll__SSeettVVaarr or TTccll__SSeettVVaarr22).  The only bits of _f_l_a_g_s that are  |
     used  are  TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY  and  TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG,  both of  |
     which have the same meaning as for TTccll__SSeettVVaarr.  If an  error  |
     occurs  in  reading  the variable (e.g. the variable doesn't  |
     exist or an array element is specified for  a  scalar  vari-  |
     able), then NULL is returned.                                 |

     TTccll__UUnnsseettVVaarr and TTccll__UUnnsseettVVaarr22 may be used to remove a vari-  |
     able,  so that future calls to TTccll__GGeettVVaarr or TTccll__GGeettVVaarr22 for  |
     the variable will return an error.  The arguments  to  these  |
     procedures  are  treated in the same way as the arguments to  |
     TTccll__GGeettVVaarr and TTccll__GGeettVVaarr22.  If the variable is successfully  |
     removed  then  0  is  returned.   If  the variable cannot be  |
     removed because it doesn't  exist  or  because  a  trace  is  |
     active  for it, then -1 is returned.  If an array element is  |
     specified, the  given  element  is  removed  but  the  array  |
     remains.   If  an  array name is specified without an index,  |
     then the entire array is removed.                             |
