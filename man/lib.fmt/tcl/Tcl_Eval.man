     TTccll__EEvvaall parses commands from _c_m_d and executes them in order
     until either an error occurs or TTccll__EEvvaall reaches a terminat-
     ing character (']' or ' ', depending on the value of _f_l_a_g_s).
     The  return  value  from  TTccll__EEvvaall  is one of the Tcl return
     codes   TTCCLL__OOKK,   TTCCLL__EERRRROORR,   TTCCLL__RREETTUURRNN,   TTCCLL__BBRREEAAKK,   or
     TTCCLL__CCOONNTTIINNUUEE, and _i_n_t_e_r_p->_r_e_s_u_l_t will point to a string with
     additional information  (result  value  or  error  message).
     This return information corresponds to the last command exe-
     cuted from _c_m_d.

     During the processing of a  command  it  is  legal  to  make
     nested  calls  to TTccll__EEvvaall (this is how conditionals, loops,
     and procedures are  implemented).   If  a  code  other  than
     TTCCLL__OOKK  is  returned from a nested TTccll__EEvvaall invocation, then
     the caller should normally return immediately, passing  that
     same  return  code  back  to its caller, and so on until the
     top-level application is reached.  A few commands, like ffoorr,
     will  check  for  certain  return  codes, like TTCCLL__BBRREEAAKK and
     TTCCLL__CCOONNTTIINNUUEE, and process them specially without returning.

     TTccll__EEvvaall keeps track of how many nested Tcl_Eval invocations
     are  in  progress  for  _i_n_t_e_r_p.   If  a  code of TTCCLL__RREETTUURRNN,
     TTCCLL__BBRREEAAKK, or TTCCLL__CCOONNTTIINNUUEE is about to be returned from  the
     topmost  TTccll__EEvvaall  invocation for _i_n_t_e_r_p, then TTccll__EEvvaall con-
     verts the return code to TTCCLL__EERRRROORR and  sets  _i_n_t_e_r_p->_r_e_s_u_l_t
     to  point  to  an  error message indicating that the rreettuurrnn,
     bbrreeaakk, or ccoonnttiinnuuee command was invoked in  an  inappropriate
     place.   This means that top-level applications should never
     see a  return  code  from  TTccll__EEvvaall  other  then  TTCCLL__OOKK  or
     TTCCLL__EERRRROORR.
