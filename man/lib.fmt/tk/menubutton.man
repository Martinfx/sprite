     The mmeennuubbuuttttoonn command creates a new window  (given  by  the
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e  argument)  and  makes it into a menubutton widget.
     Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the menubutton such as its colors, font, text,  and  ini-
     tial  relief.   The  mmeennuubbuuttttoonn command returns its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
     argument.  At the time this command is invoked,  there  must
     not  exist  a  window  named _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent
     must exist.

     A menubutton is a widget that displays a textual string  and
     is associated with a menu widget.  In normal usage, pressing
     mouse button 1 over the  menubutton  causes  the  associated
     menu  to  be  posted just underneath the menubutton.  If the
     mouse is moved over the menu before releasing the mouse but-
     ton,  the button release causes the underlying menu entry to
     be invoked.  When  the  button  is  released,  the  menu  is

     unposted.

     Menubuttons are organized into groups to  allow  menu  scan-
     ning:  if  the  mouse  button is pressed over one menubutton
     (causing it to post its menu) and the mouse  is  moved  over
     another  menubutton  in the same group without releasing the
     mouse button, then the  menu  of  the  first  menubutton  is
     unposted  and  the  menu  of  the  new  menubutton is posted
     instead.  This makes it possible to scan a row of  pull-down
     menus  to  find  a  particular entry.  Typically, all of the
     menubuttons for an application are in the same group, but it
     is possible to assign multiple groups:  this allows scanning
     within a group but not between them.

     Each menubutton is associated with a particular global vari-
     able,  determined  by  the vvaarriiaabbllee option, and the variable
     determines the menubutton's group:  all menubuttons with the
     same  associated variable are in the same group.  Whenever a
     menubutton posts its menu it stores the  path  name  of  the
     menu  in the associated variable.  Furthermore, the menubut-
     ton monitors the value of that variable  after  posting  its
     menu.   When  the variable changes value in the future (e.g.
     because some other menubutton posted its menu) then the mon-
     itoring menubutton unposts its menu and stops monitoring the
     variable.

     The mmeennuubbuuttttoonn command creates a new Tcl command whose  name
     is  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.   This  command  may be used to invoke various
     operations on the widget.   It  has  the  following  general
     form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n [_a_r_g]
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and _a_r_g determine the exact behavior of the  command.
     The following commands are possible for menubutton widgets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e aaccttiivvaattee
          Redisplay the menubutton using  its  active  foreground
          and   background   colors  instead  of  normal  colors.
          Returns an empty string.

          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are

          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the mmeennuubbuuttttoonn command.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeeaaccttiivvaattee
          Redisplay the menubutton using  its  normal  foreground
          and   background   colors  instead  of  active  colors.
          Returns an empty string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ppoosstt
          Arrange for the  menubutton's  associated  menu  to  be
          posted.   This  is done by executing a Tcl command with
          the form

                    _m_e_n_u ppoosstt _x _y _g_r_o_u_p

          where _m_e_n_u is the path name of the associated  menu,  _x
          and _y are the root-window coordinates of the lower-left
          corner of the menubutton, and _g_r_o_u_p is the name of  the
          menubutton's  group  (its  vvaarriiaabbllee option).  As a side
          effect, the path name of the associated menu is  stored
          in  the global variable associated with the menubutton.
          Returns an empty string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e uunnppoosstt
          Store an empty string in the variable  associated  with
          the menubutton.  If the menubutton has posted its menu,
          this will cause it to unpost its menu  by  executing  a
          command of the form

                    _m_e_n_u uunnppoosstt

          where _m_e_n_u is the name of the associated menu.  If  any
          other  menubutton  sharing the same variable has posted
          its menu, then that menubutton will unpost its menu  in
          a similar fashion.  Returns an empty string.


BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
     In the current implementation, new menubuttons are not given
     any  default  behavior:  you'll have to execute explicit Tcl
     commands to give the menubutton its  behavior.   This  is  a
     bug, and will be fixed soon (?).
