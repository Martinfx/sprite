     The ttoopplleevveell command creates a new toplevel widget (given by
     the   _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e  argument).   Additional  options,  described
     above, may be specified on the command line or in the option
     database  to  configure  aspects of the toplevel such as its
     background color and relief.  The ttoopplleevveell  command  returns
     the path name of the new window.

     A toplevel is similar to a frame except that it  is  created
     as a top-level window:  its X parent is the root window of a
     screen rather than the logical parent from  its  path  name.
     The primary purpose of a toplevel is to serve as a container
     for dialog boxes and other collections of widgets.  The only
     features  of  a  toplevel  are  its  background color and an
     optional 3-D border to make the toplevel  appear  raised  or
     sunken.

     Two special command-line options  may  be  provided  to  the
     ttoopplleevveell  command:  --ccllaassss and --ssccrreeeenn.  If --ccllaassss is speci-
     fied, then the new widget's class will be set  to  _c_l_a_s_s_N_a_m_e
     instead  of  TToopplleevveell.   Changing  the  class  of a toplevel
     widget may be useful in order to use a special class name in
     database  options referring to this widget and its children.
     The --ssccrreeeenn option may be used to place the window on a dif-
     ferent  screen  than the window's logical parent.  Any valid
     screen name may be used, even one  associated  with  a  dif-
     ferent display.

     Note:  --ccllaassss and --ssccrreeeenn are handled differently than other
     command-line  options.   They may not be specified using the
     option database (these  options  must  have  been  processed
     before  the  new  window  has been created enough to use the

     option database; in particular,  the  new  class  name  will
     affect the lookup of options in the database).  In addition,
     --ccllaassss and --ssccrreeeenn may not be queried or changed  using  the
     ccoonnffiigg  command  described  below.  However, the wwiinnffoo ccllaassss
     command may be used to query the  class  of  a  window,  and
     wwiinnffoo ssccrreeeenn may be used to query its screen.

     The ttoopplleevveell command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
     the  same  as  the path name of the toplevel's window.  This
     command may be used to  invoke  various  operations  on  the
     widget.  It has the following general form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n ?_a_r_g _a_r_g ...?
     _P_a_t_h_N_a_m_e is the name of the command, which is  the  same  as
     the toplevel widget's path name.  _O_p_t_i_o_n and the _a_r_gs deter-
     mine the exact behavior of the command.  The following  com-
     mands are possible for toplevel widgets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree ?_o_p_t_i_o_n? ?_v_a_l_u_e _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e ...?
          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the ttoopplleevveell command.

     When a new toplevel is created,  it  has  no  default  event
     bindings: toplevels are not intended to be interactive.
