     Command-Line Switch:--ccoommmmaanndd

          Specifies a Tcl command to associate with  the  button.
          This  command  is typically invoked when mouse button 1
          is released over the button window.

          Specifies value to store  in  the  button's  associated
          variable whenever this button is selected.  Defaults to
          the name of the radio button.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e  argument)  and makes it into a radiobutton widget.
     Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the radio button such as its colors, font, text, and ini-
     tial  relief.   The rraaddiioobbuuttttoonn command returns its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
     argument.  At the time this command is invoked,  there  must
     not  exist  a  window  named _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent
     must exist.

     A radio button is a widget that displays  a  textual  string
     and  a diamond called a _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r.  A radio button has all of
     the behavior of a simple button, including the following: it
     can   display   itself  in  either  of  two  color  schemes,
     ``active'' or ``normal'';  it can be made to appear  raised,
     sunken,  or  flat; it can be made to flash; and it invokes a
     Tcl command whenever mouse button  1  is  clicked  over  the
     check  button.  In addition, it can be _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d.  If a radio
     button is selected then a special highlight appears  in  the
     selector,  and a Tcl variable associated with the radio but-
     ton is set to a particular value.  If the  radio  button  is
     not  selected,  then  the  selector  is drawn in a different
     fashion.  Typically, several radio buttons  share  a  single
     variable.   Radio buttons conspire such that only one of the
     buttons associated with a single variable may be selected at
     once:   if  a radio button is selected, it watches the vari-
     able and automatically deselects itself whenever  the  vari-
     able  changes.   By  default  the variable sseelleecctteeddBBuuttttoonn is
     used;  its contents give the name  of  the  button  that  is
     selected,  or  the empty string if no button associated with
     that variable is selected.  The name of the variable  for  a
     radio button, plus the variable to be stored into it, may be
     modified with options on the command line or in  the  option
     database.  By default a radio button is configured to select
     itself on button clicks.

     The rraaddiioobbuuttttoonn command creates a new Tcl command whose name
     is  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.   This  command  may be used to invoke various
     operations on the widget.   It  has  the  following  general
     form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n [_a_r_g]
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and _a_r_g determine the exact behavior of the  command.
     The  following  commands are possible for radio-button widg-
     ets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e aaccttiivvaattee
          Redisplay the radio button using its active  foreground
          and background colors instead of normal colors.

radiobutton               User Commands               radiobutton



          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the rraaddiioobbuuttttoonn command.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeeaaccttiivvaattee
          Redisplay the radio button using its normal  foreground
          and background colors instead of active colors.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeesseelleecctt
          Deselect the radio  button:   redisplay  it  without  a
          highlight  in the selector and set the associated vari-
          able to an empty string.  If this radio button was  not
          currently selected, then the command has no effect.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ffllaasshh
          Flash  the  radio  button.   This  is  accomplished  by
          redisplaying  the radio button several times, alternat-
          ing between active and normal colors.  At  the  end  of
          the  flash  the  radio  button  is  left  in  the  same
          normal/active state as when the command was invoked.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e iinnvvookkee
          Does just what would have happened if the user  invoked  |
          the  radio button with the mouse: select the button and  |
          invoke its associated Tcl command,  if  there  is  one.  |
          The  return value is the return value from the Tcl com-  |
          mand, or an empty string if there is no command associ-  |
          ated with the radio button.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt
          Select the radio button:  display it with a highlighted
          selector  and  set the associated variable to the value
          corresponding to this widget.


BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
     When a new radio button is created, it is given the  follow-
     ing initial behavior by default:

     <<EEnntteerr>>             Activate.

     <<LLeeaavvee>>             Deactivate.

                         dow  before  releasing the mouse button,
                         then don't select the  radio  button  or
                         invoke its command.
