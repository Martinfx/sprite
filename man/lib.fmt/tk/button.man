     Command-Line Switch:--ccoommmmaanndd

          Specifies a Tcl command to associate with  the  button.
          This  command  is typically invoked when mouse button 1
          is released over the button window.

     Name:           hheeiigghhtt                                        |

          Specifies a desired height for the button.  If a bitmap  |
          is being displayed in the button then the value  is  in  |
          screen  units  (i.e.  any  of  the  forms acceptable to  |
          TTkk__GGeettPPiixxeellss); for text it is in  lines  of  text.   If  |
          this  option  isn't  specified,  the  button's  desired  |
          height is computed from the size of the bitmap or  text  |
          being displayed in it.                                   |

          Specifies  one of three states for the button:  nnoorrmmaall,  |
          aaccttiivvee, or ddiissaabblleedd.  In normal  state  the  button  is  |
          displayed  using the ffoorreeggrroouunndd and bbaacckkggrroouunndd options.  |
          The active state is typically used when the pointer  is  |
          over  the  button.   In  active  state  the  button  is  |
          displayed using the  aaccttiivveeFFoorreeggrroouunndd  and  aaccttiivveeBBaacckk--  |
          ggrroouunndd  options.   Disabled state means that the button  |
          is  insensitive:   it  doesn't  activate  and   doesn't  |

          Specifies  a desired width for the button.  If a bitmap  |
          is being displayed in the button then the value  is  in  |
          screen  units  (i.e.  any  of  the  forms acceptable to  |
          TTkk__GGeettPPiixxeellss); for text it is in characters.   If  this  |
          option  isn't  specified, the button's desired width is  |
          computed from the size of  the  bitmap  or  text  being  |
          displayed in it.

     The bbuuttttoonn command creates a new window (given by the  _p_a_t_h_-
     _N_a_m_e  argument)  and  makes  it into a button widget.  Addi-
     tional options, described above, may  be  specified  on  the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the button such as its colors, font,  text,  and  initial
     relief.   The  bbuuttttoonn command returns its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e argument.
     At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist  a
     window named _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent must exist.

     A button is a widget that displays a textual string or  bit-  |
     map.   It  can  display  itself in either of three different  |
     ways, according to the ssttaattee  option;  it  can  be  made  to
     appear raised, sunken, or flat; and it can be made to flash.
     When a user invokes the button (by pressing mouse  button  1
     with  the  cursor  over  the  button),  then the Tcl command
     specified in the --ccoommmmaanndd option is invoked.

     The bbuuttttoonn command creates a new Tcl command whose  name  is
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.  This command may be used to invoke various opera-
     tions on the widget.  It has the following general form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n ?_a_r_g _a_r_g ...?
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and the _a_r_gs determine the exact behavior of the com-
     mand.   The following commands are possible for button widg-
     ets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e aaccttiivvaattee
          Change the button's state to aaccttiivvee and  redisplay  the
          button  using  its  active  foreground  and  background
          colors instead  of  normal  colors.   This  command  is  |

          ignored  if  the button's state is ddiissaabblleedd.  This com-  |
          mand is obsolete and will eventually  be  removed;  use  |
          ``_p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree --ssttaattee aaccttiivvee'' instead.

          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the bbuuttttoonn command.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeeaaccttiivvaattee
          Change the button's state to nnoorrmmaall and  redisplay  the
          button  using  its  normal  foreground  and  background
          colors.  This command is ignored if the button's  state  |
          is ddiissaabblleedd.  This command is obsolete and will eventu-  |
          ally be removed; use ``_p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree  --ssttaattee  nnoorr--  |
          mmaall'' instead.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ffllaasshh
          Flash the button.  This is accomplished by redisplaying
          the  button  several  times, alternating between active
          and normal colors.  At the end of the flash the  button
          is  left  in  the  same normal/active state as when the
          command was invoked.  This command is  ignored  if  the  |
          button's state is ddiissaabblleedd.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e iinnvvookkee
          Invoke the Tcl command associated with the  button,  if  |
          there  is  one.   The  return value is the return value  |
          from the Tcl command, or an empty string if there is no  |
          command  associated  with  the button.  This command is  |
          ignored if the button's state is ddiissaabblleedd.

     Tk automatically creates class  bindings  for  buttons  that  |
     give them the following default behavior:                     |

     [1]                                                                ||
          The  button activates whenever the mouse passes over it  |
          and deactivates whenever the mouse leaves the button.    |

     [2]                                                                ||

          The button's relief is changed to sunken whenever mouse  |
          button 1 is pressed over the button, and the relief  is  |
          restored  to  its original value when button 1 is later  |
          released.                                                |

     [3]                                                                ||
          If  mouse button 1 is pressed over the button and later  |
          released over the button, the button is invoked.   How-  |
          ever, if the mouse is not over the button when button 1  |
          is released, then no invocation occurs.                  |

     If the button's state is ddiissaabblleedd then  none  of  the  above  |
     actions occur:  the button is completely non-responsive.      |

     The behavior of buttons can be changed by defining new bind-  |
     ings for individual widgets or by redefining the class bind-  |
     ings.
