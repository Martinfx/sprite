     This command arranges for _c_m_d (and _a_r_gs) to be  executed  in
     the  interpreter  named by _i_n_t_e_r_p.  It returns the result or
     error from that command execution.  _I_n_t_e_r_p must be the  name
     of  an interpreter registered on the display associated with
     the interpreter in which the command is  invoked;   it  need
     not  be  within  the same process or application.  If no _a_r_g
     arguments are present, then the command to  be  executed  is
     contained  entirely within the _c_m_d argument.  If one or more
     _a_r_gs are present, they are concatenated to form the  command
     to be executed, just as for the eevvaall Tcl command.
