     The eennttrryy command creates a new window (given by  the  _p_a_t_h_-
     _N_a_m_e  argument)  and  makes  it into an entry widget.  Addi-
     tional options, described above, may  be  specified  on  the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the entry such as its  colors,  font,  and  relief.   The
     eennttrryy  command  returns  its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e argument.  At the time
     this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent must exist.

     An entry is a widget that displays a  one-line  text  string
     and  allows  that  string to be edited using widget commands

     described below, which are typically bound to keystrokes and
     mouse  actions.   When  first  created, an entry's string is
     empty.  A portion of the entry may be selected as  described
     below.   If  an  entry  is  exporting its selection (see the  |
     eexxppoorrttSSeelleeccttiioonn option), then it will observe  the  standard  |
     X11  protocols for handling the selection;  entry selections
     are available as type  SSTTRRIINNGG.   Entries  also  observe  the
     standard Tk rules for dealing with the input focus.  When an
     entry has the input focus it displays an _i_n_s_e_r_t_i_o_n _c_u_r_s_o_r to
     indicate where new characters will be inserted.

     Entries are capable of displaying strings that are too  long
     to  fit  entirely within the widget's window.  In this case,
     only a portion of the string will  be  displayed;   commands
     described  below  may be used to change the view in the win-
     dow.  Entries use the standard ssccrroollllCCoommmmaanndd  mechanism  for
     interacting  with  scrollbars  (see  the  description of the
     ssccrroollllCCoommmmaanndd option for details).  They also support  scan-
     ning, as described below.

     The eennttrryy command creates a new Tcl command  whose  name  is
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.  This command may be used to invoke various opera-
     tions on the widget.  It has the following general form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n ?_a_r_g _a_r_g ...?
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and the _a_r_gs determine the exact behavior of the com-
     mand.

     Many of the widget commands for entries  take  one  or  more
     indices as arguments.  An index specifies a particular char-
     acter in the entry's string, in any of the following ways:

     _n_u_m_b_e_r      Specifies the character as  a  numerical  index,
                 where  0  corresponds  to the first character in
                 the string.

     ccuurrssoorr      Indicates the character adjacent to and  immedi-
                 ately following the insertion cursor.

     eenndd         Indicates the character just after the last  one
                 in  the  entry's  string.  This is equivalent to
                 specifying a numerical index equal to the length
                 of the entry's string.

     sseell..ffiirrsstt   Indicates the first character in the  selection.
                 It is an error to use this form if the selection
                 isn't in the entry window.

     sseell..llaasstt    Indicates the last character in  the  selection.
                 It is an error to use this form if the selection

                 isn't in the entry window.

     @@_n_u_m_b_e_r     In  this  form,  _n_u_m_b_e_r  is  treated  as  an  x-
                 coordinate in the entry's window;  the character
                 spanning that x-coordinate is used.   For  exam-
                 ple, ``@@00'' indicates the left-most character in
                 the window.

     Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms  above,  e.g.
     ``ee''  or  ``sseell..ff''.   In general, out-of-range indices are
     automatically rounded to the nearest legal value.

     The following commands are possible for entry widgets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree ?_o_p_t_i_o_n? ?_v_a_l_u_e _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e ...?
          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the eennttrryy command.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccuurrssoorr _i_n_d_e_x
          Arrange for the insertion cursor to be  displayed  just
          before  the character given by _i_n_d_e_x.  Returns an empty
          string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeelleettee _f_i_r_s_t ?_l_a_s_t?
          Delete one or more elements of the  entry.   _F_i_r_s_t  and
          _l_a_s_t are indices of of the first and last characters in
          the range to be deleted.   If _l_a_s_t isn't  specified  it
          defaults  to _f_i_r_s_t, i.e. a single character is deleted.
          This command returns an empty string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ggeett
          Returns the entry's string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e iinnddeexx _i_n_d_e_x
          Returns the numerical index corresponding to _i_n_d_e_x.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e iinnsseerrtt _i_n_d_e_x _s_t_r_i_n_g
          Insert the characters of _s_t_r_i_n_g just before the charac-
          ter indicated by _i_n_d_e_x.  Returns an empty string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ssccaann _o_p_t_i_o_n _a_r_g_s

entry                     User Commands                     entry



          This command is used to implement scanning on  entries.
          It has two forms, depending on _o_p_t_i_o_n:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ssccaann mmaarrkk _x
               Records _x and the current view in the  entry  win-
               dow;   used  in conjunction with later ssccaann ddrraaggttoo
               commands.  Typically this  command  is  associated
               with  a  mouse  button  press  in  the widget.  It
               returns an empty string.

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ssccaann ddrraaggttoo _x
               This command computes the difference between its _x
               argument  and the _x argument to the last ssccaann mmaarrkk
               command for the widget.  It then adjusts the  view
               left  or  right  by  10 times the difference in x-
               coordinates.  This command is typically associated
               with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce
               the effect of dragging the  entry  at  high  speed
               through  the window.  The return value is an empty
               string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt _o_p_t_i_o_n _a_r_g
          This command is used to adjust the selection within  an
          entry.  It has several forms, depending on _o_p_t_i_o_n:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt aaddjjuusstt _i_n_d_e_x
               Locate the end of the  selection  nearest  to  the
               character  given  by _i_n_d_e_x, and adjust that end of
               the selection to be at _i_n_d_e_x  (i.e  including  but
               not  going  beyond  _i_n_d_e_x).   The other end of the
               selection is made  the  anchor  point  for  future
               sseelleecctt   ttoo  commands.   If  the  selection  isn't
               currently in the entry, then a  new  selection  is
               created  to  include  the characters between _i_n_d_e_x
               and  the  most  recent  selection  anchor   point,
               inclusive.  Returns an empty string.

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt cclleeaarr
               Clear the selection if it  is  currently  in  this
               widget.   If  the  selection  isn't in this widget
               then the command has no effect.  Returns an  empty
               string.

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt ffrroomm _i_n_d_e_x
               Set the selection anchor point to just before  the
               character  given  by  _i_n_d_e_x.   Doesn't  change the
               selection.  Returns an empty string.

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt ttoo _i_n_d_e_x
               Set the selection to consist of the elements  from
               the anchor point to element _i_n_d_e_x, inclusive.  The
               anchor point is  determined  by  the  most  recent

               then  a  new  selection  is created using the most
               recent anchor  point  specified  for  the  widget.
               Returns an empty string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e vviieeww _i_n_d_e_x
          Adjust the view in the entry so that element  _i_n_d_e_x  is
          at  the  left  edge  of  the  window.  Returns an empty

     Tk automatically creates class  bindings  for  entries  that  |
     give them the following default behavior:                     |

     [1]                                                                ||
          Clicking  mouse  button  1  in  an  entry positions the  |
          insertion cursor just before the  character  underneath  |
          the  mouse  cursor  and  sets  the  input focus to this  |
          widget.                                                  |

     [2]                                                                ||
          Dragging  with  mouse  button 1 strokes out a selection  |
          between the insertion cursor and  the  character  under  |
          the mouse.                                               |

          The  ends  of the selection can be adjusted by dragging  |
          with mouse button 1 while the shift key is down;   this  |
          will  adjust  the end of the selection that was nearest  |
          to the mouse cursor when button 1 was pressed.           |

     [4]                                                                ||
          The  view in the entry can be adjusted by dragging with  |
          mouse button 2.                                          |

          If the input focus is in an entry widget and characters  |
          are typed on the keyboard, the characters are  inserted  |
          just before the insertion cursor.                        |

     [6]                                                                ||

          Control-v inserts the current selection just before the  |
          insertion cursor.                                        |

          Control-d  deletes  the  selected characters;  an error  |
          occurs if the selection is not in this widget.           |

     If the entry is disabled using the ssttaattee  option,  then  the  |
     entry's view can still be adjusted and text in the entry can  |
     still be selected, but no insertion cursor will be displayed  |
     and no text modifications will take place.                    |

     The behavior of entries can be changed by defining new bind-  |
     ings for individual widgets or by redefining the class bind-  |
     ings.
