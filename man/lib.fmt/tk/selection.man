     This command provides a Tcl interface  to  the  X  selection
     mechanism  and  implements  the full selection functionality
     described in the X  Inter-Client  Communication  Conventions
     Manual  (ICCCM),  except  that  it supports only the primary
     selection.

     The sseelleeccttiioonn ggeett form of the command retrieves the value of
     the  primary  selection  and  returns  it as a result.  TTyyppee
     specifies the form in which the selection is to be  returned
     (the  desired  ``target'' for conversion, in ICCCM terminol-
     ogy),  and  should  be  an  atom  name  such  as  STRING  or
     FILE_NAME;   see  the Inter-Client Communication Conventions
     Manual for complete details.  TTyyppee defaults to STRING.   The
     selection owner may choose to return the selection in any of
     several different representation formats,  such  as  STRING,
     ATOM,  INTEGER,  etc.  (this  format  is  different than the
     selection  type;   see  the  ICCCM  for  all  the  confusing
     details).  If the selection is returned in a non-string for-
     mat, such as INTEGER or ATOM, the sseelleeccttiioonn command converts
     it  to  string format as a collection of fields separated by
     spaces:  atoms are converted to  their  textual  names,  and
     anything else is converted to hexadecimal integers.

     The sseelleeccttiioonn hhaannddllee command creates a handler for selection
     requests:  it  arranges  for _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to be executed whenever
     the  primary  selection  is  owned  by  _w_i_n_d_o_w  and  someone
     attempts to retrieve it in the form given by _t_y_p_e (e.g. _t_y_p_e
     is specified in the sseelleeccttiioonn ggeett command).   _T_y_p_e  defaults
     to STRING.

     When the retrieval occurs, two additional  numbers  will  be
     appended to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d (with space separators), and the result-
     ing string will be executed as a Tcl command.  The two addi-
     tional  numbers are _o_f_f_s_e_t and _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s:  _o_f_f_s_e_t specifies a
     starting character position in the  selection  and  _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s
     gives  the maximum number of bytes to retrieve.  The command
     should return a value consisting of at most _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s of  the
     selection,  starting  at  position  _o_f_f_s_e_t.   For very large
     selections (larger than  _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s)  the  selection  will  be

     retrieved using several invocations of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with increas-
     ing _o_f_f_s_e_t values.  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d returns a string whose length
     is  less  than  _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s,  the  return  value  is assumed to
     include all of the  remainder  of  the  selection;   if  the
     length of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d's result is equal to _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s then _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     will be invoked again, until it eventually returns a  result
     shorter than _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s.  The value of _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s will always be
     relatively large (thousands of bytes).

     The _f_o_r_m_a_t argument specifies the representation that should
     be  used  to  transmit  the  selection to the requester (the
     second column of Table 2 of  the  ICCCM),  and  defaults  to
     STRING.   If  _f_o_r_m_a_t is STRING, the selection is transmitted
     as 8-bit ASCII characters (i.e.  just in the  form  returned
     by  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d).  If _f_o_r_m_a_t is ATOM, then the return value from
     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is divided into fields  separated  by  white  space;
     each  field  is  converted to its atom value, and the 32-bit
     atom value is transmitted instead of the atom name.  For any
     other  _f_o_r_m_a_t, the return value from _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is divided into
     fields separated by white space and each field is  converted
     to a 32-bit integer;  an array of integers is transmitted to
     the selection requester.

     The _f_o_r_m_a_t argument is needed only  for  compatibility  with
     selection  requesters  that don't use Tk.  If the Tk toolkit
     is being used to retrieve the selection then  the  value  is
     converted  back to a string at the requesting end, so _f_o_r_m_a_t
     is irrelevant.

     If no handler has been declared for  type  TARGETS  or  type
     TIMESTAMP,   Tk  will  automatically  respond  to  selection
     requests for these types.
