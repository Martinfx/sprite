     Command-Line Switch:--ccoommmmaanndd

          Specifies a Tcl command to associate with  the  button.
          This  command  is typically invoked when mouse button 1
          is released over the button window.

          Specifies a desired height for the button.  If a bitmap  |
          is being displayed in the button then the value  is  in  |
          screen  units  (i.e.  any  of  the  forms acceptable to  |
          TTkk__GGeettPPiixxeellss); for text it is in  lines  of  text.   If  |
          this  option  isn't  specified,  the  button's  desired  |
          height is computed from the size of the bitmap or  text  |
          being displayed in it.

          Specifies value to store  in  the  button's  associated
          variable  whenever this button is deselected.  Defaults

          Specifies the color to draw in the selector  when  this
          button  is  selected.   If specified as an empty string  |
          then no selector is drawn for the button.

          Specifies name of global variable to  set  to  indicate
          whether  or  not  this button is selected.  Defaults to
          the name of the button.

     Name:           wwiiddtthh                                         |

          Specifies  a desired width for the button.  If a bitmap  |
          is being displayed in the button then the value  is  in  |
          screen  units  (i.e.  any  of  the  forms acceptable to  |
          TTkk__GGeettPPiixxeellss); for text it is in characters.   If  this  |
          option  isn't  specified, the button's desired width is  |
          computed from the size of  the  bitmap  or  text  being  |
          displayed in it.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The cchheecckkbbuuttttoonn command creates a new window (given  by  the
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e  argument) and makes it into a check-button widget.
     Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the check button such as its colors, font, text, and ini-
     tial  relief.   The cchheecckkbbuuttttoonn command returns its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
     argument.  At the time this command is invoked,  there  must
     not  exist  a  window  named _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent
     must exist.

     A check button is a widget that displays a textual string or  |
     bitmap  and  a square called a _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r.  A check button has
     all of the behavior of a simple button, including  the  fol-
     lowing:  it  can  display  itself  in  either  of  two color
     schemes, ``active'' or ``normal'';  it can be made to appear
     raised,  sunken,  or  flat;  it can be made to flash; and it
     invokes a Tcl command whenever mouse  button  1  is  clicked

     over the check button.

     In addition, check buttons can be _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d.  If a check but-
     ton  is  selected  then  a  special highlight appears in the
     selector, and a Tcl variable associated with the check  but-
     ton is set to a particular value (normally 1).  If the check
     button is not selected, then the selector is drawn in a dif-
     ferent  fashion and the associated variable is set to a dif-
     ferent value (typically 0).  By default,  the  name  of  the
     variable  associated  with a check button is the same as the
     _n_a_m_e used to create the check button.   The  variable  name,
     and the ``on'' and ``off'' values stored in it, may be modi-
     fied with options on the command line or in the option data-
     base.  By default a check button is configured to select and
     deselect itself on alternate button  clicks.   In  addition,  |
     each  check  button  monitors  its  associated  variable and  |
     automatically selects and deselects itself  when  the  vari-  |
     ables value changes to and from the button's ``on'' value.


WWIIDDGGEETT CCOOMMMMAANNDD
     The cchheecckkbbuuttttoonn command creates a new Tcl command whose name
     is  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.   This  command  may be used to invoke various
     operations on the widget.   It  has  the  following  general
     form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n ?_a_r_g _a_r_g ...?
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and the _a_r_gs determine the exact behavior of the com-
     mand.   The following commands are possible for check-button
     widgets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e aaccttiivvaattee
          Redisplay the check button using its active  foreground
          and background colors instead of normal colors.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree ?_o_p_t_i_o_n? ?_v_a_l_u_e _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e ...?
          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the cchheecckkbbuuttttoonn command.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeeaaccttiivvaattee

          and background colors instead of active colors.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeesseelleecctt
          Deselect the check  button:   redisplay  it  without  a
          highlight  in the selector and set the associated vari-
          able to its ``off'' value.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ffllaasshh
          Flash  the  check  button.   This  is  accomplished  by
          redisplaying  the check button several times, alternat-
          ing between active and normal colors.  At  the  end  of
          the  flash  the  check  button  is  left  in  the  same
          normal/active state as when the command was invoked.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e iinnvvookkee
          Does just what would have happened if the user  invoked  |
          the  check  button with the mouse: toggle the selection  |
          state of the button and invoke the Tcl command  associ-  |
          ated  with  the  check  button,  if  there is one.  The  |
          return value is the return value from the Tcl  command,  |
          or  an  empty  string if there is no command associated  |
          with the check button.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt
          Select the check button:  display it with a highlighted
          selector  and set the associated variable to its ``on''
          value.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ttooggggllee
          Toggle the selection state of the button,  redisplaying
          it and modifying its associated variable to reflect the
          new state.

     Tk automatically creates class bindings  for  check  buttons  |
     that give them the following default behavior:                |

     [1]                                                                ||
          The  check  button  activates whenever the mouse passes  |
          over it and deactivates whenever the mouse  leaves  the  |
          check button.                                            |

     [2]                                                                ||
          The check button's relief is changed to sunken whenever  |
          mouse button 1 is pressed over it, and  the  relief  is  |
          restored  to  its original value when button 1 is later  |
          released.                                                |

     [3]                                                                ||
          If  mouse button 1 is pressed over the check button and  |
          later released over the check button, the check  button  |

          is  invoked  (i.e.  its selection state toggles and the  |
          command associated with the button is invoked, if there  |
          is  one).   However, if the mouse is not over the check  |
          button when button 1 is released,  then  no  invocation  |
          occurs.                                                  |

     The behavior of check buttons can be changed by defining new  |
     bindings  for  individual widgets or by redefining the class  |
     bindings.
