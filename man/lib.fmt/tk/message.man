          Specifies  a  non-negative  integer  value   indicating
          desired  aspect ratio for the window.  The aspect ratio
          is specified as 100*width/height.  100 means the window
          should  be  as wide as it is tall, 200 means the window
          should be twice as wide as it is  tall,  50  means  the
          window  should  be  twice as tall as it is wide, and so
          on.  Defaults to 150.

     The mmeessssaaggee command creates a new window (given by the _p_a_t_h_-
     _N_a_m_e  argument)  and  makes it into a message widget.  Addi-
     tional options, described above, may  be  specified  on  the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the message such as its colors, font, text,  and  initial
     relief.   The mmeessssaaggee command returns its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e argument.
     At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist  a
     window named _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent must exist.

     A message is a widget that displays  a  textual  string.   A
     message widget has three special features.  First, it breaks
     up its string into lines in order to produce a given  aspect

     ratio  for  the  window.  The line breaks are chosen at word
     boundaries wherever possible (if  not  even  a  single  word
     would  fit  on  a  line,  then the word will be split across
     lines).  Newline characters in the string  will  force  line
     breaks;  they can be used, for example, to leave blank lines
     in the display.

     The second feature of a  message  widget  is  justification.
     The  text  may be displayed left-justified (each line starts
     at the left side of the window), centered on a  line-by-line
     basis,  or right-justified (each line ends at the right side
     of the window).

     The third feature of a message widget  is  that  it  handles
     control  characters  and  non-printing characters specially.
     Tab characters are replaced with enough blank space to  line
     up  on  the  next 8-character boundary.  Newlines cause line
     breaks.  Other control  characters  (ASCII  code  less  than
     0x20)  and  characters not defined in the font are displayed
     as a four-character sequence \\xx_h_h where _h_h is the  two-digit
     hexadecimal  number  corresponding to the character.  In the
     unusual case where the font doesn't contain all of the char-
     acters in ``0123456789abcdef\x'' then control characters and
     undefined characters are not displayed at all.

     The mmeessssaaggee command creates a new Tcl command whose name  is
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.  This command may be used to invoke various opera-
     tions on the widget.  It has the following general form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n ?_a_r_g _a_r_g ...?
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and the _a_r_gs determine the exact behavior of the com-
     mand.  The following commands are possible for message widg-
     ets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree ?_o_p_t_i_o_n? ?_v_a_l_u_e _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e ...?
          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the mmeessssaaggee command.

     When a new message is created, it has no default event bind-
     ings: messages are intended for output purposes only.

     Tabs don't work very well with  text  that  is  centered  or
     right-justified.  The most common result is that the line is
     justified wrong.
