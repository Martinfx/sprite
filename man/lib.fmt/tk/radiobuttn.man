     Class:          CCoommmmaanndd
     Command-Line Switch:--ccoommmmaanndd

          Specifies a Tcl command to associate with  the  button.
          This  command  is typically invoked when mouse button 1
          is released over the button window.

          Specifies a desired height for the button.  If a bitmap  |
          is being displayed in the button then the value  is  in  |
          screen  units  (i.e.  any  of  the  forms acceptable to  |
          TTkk__GGeettPPiixxeellss); for text it is in  lines  of  text.   If  |
          this  option  isn't  specified,  the  button's  desired  |
          height is computed from the size of the bitmap or  text  |
          being displayed in it.

     Class:          VVaarriiaabbllee
     Command-Line Switch:--vvaarriiaabbllee

          Specifies name of global variable to set whenever  this
          button  is  selected.   Changes  in  this variable also
          cause  the  button  to  select  or   deselect   itself.
          Defaults to the value sseelleecctteeddBBuuttttoonn.

          Specifies  a desired width for the button.  If a bitmap  |
          is being displayed in the button then the value  is  in  |
          screen  units  (i.e.  any  of  the  forms acceptable to  |
          TTkk__GGeettPPiixxeellss); for text it is in characters.   If  this  |
          option  isn't  specified, the button's desired width is  |
          computed from the size of  the  bitmap  or  text  being  |
          displayed in it.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The rraaddiioobbuuttttoonn command creates a new window (given  by  the
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e  argument)  and makes it into a radiobutton widget.
     Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the radio button such as its colors, font, text, and ini-
     tial  relief.   The rraaddiioobbuuttttoonn command returns its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
     argument.  At the time this command is invoked,  there  must
     not  exist  a  window  named _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent
     must exist.

     A radio button is a widget that displays a textual string or  |
     bitmap  and a diamond called a _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r.  A radio button has
     all of the behavior of a simple button, including  the  fol-
     lowing:  it  can  display  itself  in  either  of  two color
     schemes, ``active'' or ``normal'';  it can be made to appear
     raised,  sunken,  or  flat;  it can be made to flash; and it
     invokes a Tcl command whenever mouse  button  1  is  clicked
     over the check button.

     In addition, radio buttons can be _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d.  If a radio but-
     ton  is  selected  then  a  special highlight appears in the
     selector and a Tcl variable associated with the radio button
     is  set  to  a particular value.  If the radio button is not
     selected then the selector is drawn in a different  fashion.

radiobutton               User Commands               radiobutton



     Typically, several radio buttons share a single variable and
     the value of the variable indicates which radio button is to
     be  selected.   When  a radio button is selected it sets the  |
     value of the variable to indicate  that  fact;   each  radio  |
     button also monitors the value of the variable and automati-  |
     cally selects and deselects itself when the variable's value  |
     changes.   By  default  the variable sseelleecctteeddBBuuttttoonn is used;
     its contents give the name of the button that  is  selected,
     or  the empty string if no button associated with that vari-
     able is selected.  The name of the variable for a radio but-
     ton, plus the variable to be stored into it, may be modified
     with options on the command line or in the option  database.
     By  default a radio button is configured to select itself on
     button clicks.

     The rraaddiioobbuuttttoonn command creates a new Tcl command whose name
     is  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.   This  command  may be used to invoke various
     operations on the widget.   It  has  the  following  general
     form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n ?_a_r_g _a_r_g ...?
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and the _a_r_gs determine the exact behavior of the com-
     mand.   The following commands are possible for radio-button
     widgets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e aaccttiivvaattee
          Redisplay the radio button using its active  foreground
          and background colors instead of normal colors.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree ?_o_p_t_i_o_n? ?_v_a_l_u_e _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e ...?
          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the rraaddiioobbuuttttoonn command.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeeaaccttiivvaattee
          Redisplay the radio button using its normal  foreground
          and background colors instead of active colors.

          highlight  in the selector and set the associated vari-
          able to an empty string.  If this radio button was  not
          currently selected, then the command has no effect.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ffllaasshh
          Flash  the  radio  button.   This  is  accomplished  by
          redisplaying  the radio button several times, alternat-
          ing between active and normal colors.  At  the  end  of
          the  flash  the  radio  button  is  left  in  the  same
          normal/active state as when the command was invoked.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e iinnvvookkee
          Does just what would have happened if the user  invoked  |
          the  radio button with the mouse: select the button and  |
          invoke its associated Tcl command,  if  there  is  one.  |
          The  return value is the return value from the Tcl com-  |
          mand, or an empty string if there is no command associ-  |
          ated with the radio button.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt
          Select the radio button:  display it with a highlighted
          selector  and  set the associated variable to the value
          corresponding to this widget.

     Tk automatically creates class bindings  for  radio  buttons  |
     that give them the following default behavior:                |

     [1]                                                                ||
          The  radio  button  activates whenever the mouse passes  |
          over it and deactivates whenever the mouse  leaves  the  |
          radio button.                                            |

     [2]                                                                ||
          The radio button's relief is changed to sunken whenever  |
          mouse button 1 is pressed over it, and  the  relief  is  |
          restored  to  its original value when button 1 is later  |
          released.                                                |

     [3]                                                                ||
          If  mouse button 1 is pressed over the radio button and  |
          later released over the radio button, the radio  button  |
          is invoked (i.e. it is selected and the command associ-  |
          ated with the button is  invoked,  if  there  is  one).  |
          However, if the mouse is not over the radio button when  |
          button 1 is released, then no invocation occurs.         |

     The behavior of radio buttons can be changed by defining new  |
     bindings  for  individual widgets or by redefining the class  |
     bindings.
