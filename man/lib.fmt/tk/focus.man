     If no _w_i_n_d_o_w is specified, return the path name of the  win-
     dow  that currently has the input focus for this application
     (or nnoonnee if no window has claimed the focus).  If _w_i_n_d_o_w  is
     specified  then  give  it  the  input  focus (all future key
     presses and releases in any window  sharing  the  same  main
     window  as _w_i_n_d_o_w will be sent to _w_i_n_d_o_w).  In this case the
     return value is an empty string.  If _w_i_n_d_o_w is specified  as  |
     nnoonnee then the focus is cleared for this application.
