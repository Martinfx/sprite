DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     TTkk__OOwwnnSSeelleeccttiioonn arranges for _t_k_w_i_n to become the  new  owner
     of the primary selection.  After this call completes, future
     requests for the selection  will  be  directed  to  handlers
     created  for  _t_k_w_i_n  using  TTkk__CCrreeaatteeSSeellHHaannddlleerr.  When _t_k_w_i_n
     eventually loses  the  selection  ownership,  _p_r_o_c  will  be
     invoked  so  that  the  window  can clean itself up (e.g. by
     unhighlighting the selection).  _P_r_o_c should  have  arguments
     and result that match the type TTkk__LLoossttSSeellPPrroocc:
          typedef void Tk_LostSelProc(ClientData _c_l_i_e_n_t_D_a_t_a);
     The _c_l_i_e_n_t_D_a_t_a parameter to _p_r_o_c is a copy of the _c_l_i_e_n_t_D_a_t_a
     argument  given to TTkk__OOwwnnSSeelleeccttiioonn, and is usually a pointer
     to a data structure containing application-specific informa-
     tion about _t_k_w_i_n.

     Once a window has become selection  owner,  it  will  remain
     owner until either the window is deleted or until some other
     window claims ownership.  There is no way for  a  window  to
     disavow ownership of the selection once it has received it.
