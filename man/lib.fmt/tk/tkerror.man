     The ttkkeerrrroorr command doesn't exist as part of  Tk.   Instead,
     individual  applications  or users can define a ttkkeerrrroorr com-
     mand (e.g. as a Tcl procedure) if they wish to handle  back-
     ground errors.

     A background error is one that  occurs  in  a  command  that
     didn't  originate  with the application.  For example, if an
     error occurs while executing a command specified with a bbiinndd
     of  aafftteerr  command,  then  it  is a background error.  For a
     non-background error, the error can simply  be  returned  up
     through  nested Tcl command evaluations until it reaches the
     top-level code in the application; then the application  can
     report  the  error  in whatever way it wishes.  When a back-
     ground error occurs, the unwinding ends in  the  Tk  library
     and there is no obvious way for Tk to report the error.

     When Tk detects a background error, it invokes  the  ttkkeerrrroorr
     command,  passing it the error message as its only argument.
     Tk assumes that the application has implemented the  ttkkeerrrroorr
     command, and that the command will report the error in a way
     that makes sense for the application.  Tk  will  ignore  any
     result returned by the ttkkeerrrroorr command.

     If another Tcl error occurs within the ttkkeerrrroorr command (e.g.
     because  the  application hasn't defined a ttkkeerrrroorr command),
     then Tk reports the error itself by  writing  a  message  to
     stderr.
