     The lliissttbbooxx command creates a new window (given by the _p_a_t_h_-
     _N_a_m_e  argument)  and  makes it into a listbox widget.  Addi-
     tional options, described above, may  be  specified  on  the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the listbox such as its colors, font, text,  and  relief.
     The  lliissttbbooxx  command returns its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e argument.  At the
     time this command is invoked, there must not exist a  window
     named _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent must exist.

     A listbox is a widget that displays a list of  strings,  one
     per line.  When first created, a new listbox has no elements
     in its list.  Elements may be added or deleted using  widget
     commands described below.  In addition, one or more elements
     may be selected as described below.  If a listbox is export-  |
     ing its selection (see eexxppoorrttSSeelleeccttiioonn option), then it will  |
     observe the standard X11 protocols for handling  the  selec-
     tion;  listbox selections are available as type SSTTRRIINNGG, con-
     sisting of a Tcl list with one entry for each selected  ele-
     ment.

     For large lists only a subset of the list elements  will  be
     displayed in the listbox window at once;  commands described
     below may be used to change the view in the  window.   List-
     boxes  allow scrolling in both directions using the standard  |
     xxSSccrroollllCCoommmmaanndd and yySSccrroollllCCoommmmaanndd options.  They  also  sup-
     port scanning, as described below.

WWIIDDGGEETT CCOOMMMMAANNDD
     The lliissttbbooxx command creates a new Tcl command whose name  is
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.  This command may be used to invoke various opera-
     tions on the widget.  It has the following general form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n ?_a_r_g _a_r_g ...?
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and the _a_r_gs determine the exact behavior of the com-
     mand.  The following commands are possible for listbox widg-
     ets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree ?_o_p_t_i_o_n? ?_v_a_l_u_e _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e ...?
          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the lliissttbbooxx command.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccuurrsseelleeccttiioonn
          Returns a list containing the indices  of  all  of  the  |
          elements  in  the  listbox that are currently selected.  |
          If there are no elements selected in the  listbox  then  |
          an empty string is returned.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeelleettee _f_i_r_s_t ?_l_a_s_t?
          Delete one or more elements of the listbox.  _F_i_r_s_t  and
          _l_a_s_t  give  the  integer  indices of the first and last
          elements in the range to be  deleted.   If  _l_a_s_t  isn't
          specified  it  defaults to _f_i_r_s_t, i.e. a single element
          is deleted.  An index of 00  corresponds  to  the  first
          element  in  the  listbox.  Either _f_i_r_s_t or _l_a_s_t may be
          specified as eenndd, in which case it refers to  the  last
          element  of the listbox.  This command returns an empty
          string

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ggeett _i_n_d_e_x
          Return the contents of the listbox element indicated by
          _i_n_d_e_x.    _I_n_d_e_x  must  be  a  non-negative  integer  (0
          corresponds to the first element in the listbox), or it
          may  also be specified as eenndd to indicate the last ele-
          ment in the listbox.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e iinnsseerrtt _i_n_d_e_x ?_e_l_e_m_e_n_t _e_l_e_m_e_n_t ...?
          Insert zero or more  new  elements  in  the  list  just
          before  the  element  given  by  _i_n_d_e_x.   If  _i_n_d_e_x  is

          specified as eenndd then the new elements are added to the
          end of the list.  Returns an empty string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e nneeaarreesstt _y
          Given a y-coordinate within the  listbox  window,  this
          command returns the index of the (visible) listbox ele-
          ment nearest to that y-coordinate.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ssccaann _o_p_t_i_o_n _a_r_g_s
          This command is used to  implement  scanning  on  list-
          boxes.  It has two forms, depending on _o_p_t_i_o_n:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ssccaann mmaarrkk _x _y
               Records _x and _y and the current view in the  list-  |
               box  window;   used in conjunction with later ssccaann  |
               ddrraaggttoo commands.  Typically this command is  asso-  |
               ciated  with  a  mouse button press in the widget.  |
               It returns an empty string.                         |

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ssccaann ddrraaggttoo _x _y.                                     ||
               This command computes the difference between its _x  |
               and _y arguments and the _x and _y arguments  to  the  |
               last  ssccaann  mmaarrkk  command for the widget.  It then  |
               adjusts the view by 10  times  the  difference  in  |
               coordinates.  This command is typically associated
               with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce
               the  effect  of  dragging  the  list at high speed
               through the window.  The return value is an  empty
               string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt _o_p_t_i_o_n _a_r_g
          This command is used to adjust the selection  within  a
          listbox.   It  has  several forms, depending on _o_p_t_i_o_n.
          In all of the forms the index eenndd refers  to  the  last
          element in the listbox.

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt aaddjjuusstt _i_n_d_e_x
               Locate the end of the  selection  nearest  to  the
               element given by _i_n_d_e_x, and adjust that end of the
               selection to be at _i_n_d_e_x (i.e  including  but  not
               going  beyond _i_n_d_e_x).  The other end of the selec-
               tion is made the anchor point for future sseelleecctt ttoo
               commands.  If the selection isn't currently in the
               listbox, then this command  is  identical  to  the
               sseelleecctt  ffrroomm  widget  command.   Returns  an empty
               string.

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt cclleeaarr
               If the selection is in this  listbox  then  it  is  |
               cleared so that none of the listbox's elements are  |
               selected anymore.

               Set the selection to consist of element _i_n_d_e_x, and
               make  _i_n_d_e_x  the anchor point for future sseelleecctt ttoo
               widget commands.  Returns an empty string.

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt ttoo _i_n_d_e_x
               Set the selection to consist of the elements  from
               the anchor point to element _i_n_d_e_x, inclusive.  The
               anchor point is  determined  by  the  most  recent
               sseelleecctt  ffrroomm  or  sseelleecctt  aaddjjuusstt  command  in this
               widget.  If the selection isn't  in  this  widget,
               this command is identical to sseelleecctt ffrroomm.  Returns
               an empty string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ssiizzee
          Returns a decimal string indicating the total number of
          elements in the listbox.  Returns an empty string.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e xxvviieeww _i_n_d_e_x
          Adjust the view in the listbox so that character  posi-  |
          tion _i_n_d_e_x is displayed at the left edge of the widget.  |
          Returns an empty string.                                 |

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e yyvviieeww _i_n_d_e_x                                               ||
          Adjust the view in the listbox so that element _i_n_d_e_x is  |
          displayed at the top of the widget.  If _i_n_d_e_x is speci-  |
          fied  as eenndd it indicates the last element of the list-  |
          box.  Returns an empty string.


DDEEFFAAUULLTT BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
     Tk automatically creates class bindings for  listboxes  that  |
     give them the following default behavior:                     |

     [1]                                                                ||
          When  button  1  is pressed over a listbox, the element  |
          underneath the mouse cursor is selected.  The mouse can  |
          be dragged to select a range of elements.                |

     [2]                                                                ||
          The  ends  of the selection can be adjusted by dragging  |
          with mouse button 1 while the shift key is down;   this  |
          will  adjust  the end of the selection that was nearest  |
          to the mouse cursor when button 1 was pressed.           |

     [3]                                                                ||
          The  view  in  the  listbox can be adjusted by dragging  |
          with mouse button 2.                                     |

     The behavior of listboxes can be  changed  by  defining  new  |
     bindings  for  individual widgets or by redefining the class  |
     bindings.
