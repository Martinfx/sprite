     Command-Line Switch:--ccoommmmaanndd

          Specifies the prefix of a  Tcl  command  to  invoke  to
          change  the  view  in  the  widget  associated with the
          scrollbar.  When a user requests a view change by mani-
          pulating  the scrollbar, a Tcl command is invoked.  The
          actual command consists of this option  followed  by  a
          space  and  a number.  The number indicates the logical
          unit that should appear at the top  of  the  associated
          window.

          Specifies the desired narrow dimension of the scrollbar
          window, not including 3-D border, if any.  For vertical
          scrollbars this will be the width  and  for  horizontal
          scrollbars this will be the height.  The value may have  |

     The ssccrroollllbbaarr command creates a new  window  (given  by  the
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e  argument)  and  makes  it into a scrollbar widget.
     Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the  scrollbar  such  as  its  colors,  orientation,  and
     relief.   The  ssccrroollllbbaarr  command returns its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e argu-
     ment.  At the time this command is invoked, there  must  not
     exist  a  window  named _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent must
     exist.

scrollbar                 User Commands                 scrollbar



     A scrollbar is a widget that displays  two  arrows,  one  at
     each  end  of the scrollbar, and a _s_l_i_d_e_r in the middle por-
     tion of the scrollbar.   A  scrollbar  is  used  to  provide
     information  about  what  is visible in an _a_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_e_d _w_i_n_d_o_w
     that displays an object of some sort (such as a  file  being
     edited  or  a drawing).  The position and size of the slider
     indicate which portion of the object is visible in the asso-
     ciated  window.   For  example,  if the slider in a vertical
     scrollbar covers the top third of the area between  the  two
     arrows, it means that the associated window displays the top
     third of its object.

     Scrollbars can be used to adjust the view in the  associated
     window  by  clicking  or  dragging  with the mouse.  See the
     BINDINGS section below for details.

     The ssccrroollllbbaarr command creates a new Tcl command  whose  name
     is  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.   This  command  may be used to invoke various
     operations on the widget.   It  has  the  following  general
     form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n ?_a_r_g _a_r_g ...?
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and the _a_r_gs determine the exact behavior of the com-
     mand.   The  following  commands  are possible for scrollbar
     widgets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree ?_o_p_t_i_o_n? ?_v_a_l_u_e _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e ...?
          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the ssccrroollllbbaarr command.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ggeett
          Returns a Tcl  list  containing  four  decimal  values,
          which  are  the  current  _t_o_t_a_l_U_n_i_t_s, _w_i_d_n_o_w_U_n_i_t_s, _f_i_r_-
          _s_t_U_n_i_t, and _l_a_s_t_U_n_i_t values for the  scrollbar.   These
          are  the values from the most recent sseett widget command
          on the scrollbar.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseett _t_o_t_a_l_U_n_i_t_s _w_i_n_d_o_w_U_n_i_t_s _f_i_r_s_t_U_n_i_t _l_a_s_t_U_n_i_t
          This  command  is  invoked  to   give   the   scrollbar

scrollbar                 User Commands                 scrollbar



          information   about  the  widget  associated  with  the
          scrollbar.  _T_o_t_a_l_U_n_i_t_s is an integer value  giving  the
          total size of the object being displayed in the associ-
          ated widget.  The meaning of one unit  depends  on  the
          associated  widget;   for  example,  in  a  text editor
          widget units might correspond to lines of  text.   _W_i_n_-
          _d_o_w_U_n_i_t_s  indicates  the total number of units that can
          fit in the associated window at  one  time.   _F_i_r_s_t_U_n_i_t
          and  _l_a_s_t_U_n_i_t  give  the  indices of the first and last
          units currently visible in the associated window  (zero
          corresponds  to  the  first  unit of the object).  This
          command should be  invoked  by  the  associated  widget
          whenever its object or window changes size and whenever
          it changes the view in its window.


BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
     The  description   below   assumes   a   vertically-oriented
     scrollbar.   For  a  horizontally-oriented scrollbar replace
     the words ``up'', ``down'',  ``top'',  and  ``bottom''  with
     ``left'', ``right'', ``left'', and ``right'', respectively

     A scrollbar widget is  divided  into  five  distinct  areas.
     From  top  to  bottom, they are:  the top arrow, the top gap
     (the empty space between the  arrow  and  the  slider),  the
     slider,  the  bottom  gap,  and  the bottom arrow.  Pressing
     mouse button 1 in each area has a different effect:

     ttoopp aarrrrooww           Causes the view in the associated window
                         to shift up by one unit (i.e. the object
                         appears to move down  one  unit  in  its
                         window).  If the button is held down the
                         action will auto-repeat.

     ttoopp ggaapp             Causes the view in the associated window
                         to  shift up by one less than the number
                         of units in the window (i.e. the portion
                         of the object that used to appear at the
                         very top of the window will  now  appear
                         at  the  very bottom).  If the button is
                         held down the action will auto-repeat.

     sslliiddeerr              Pressing button 1 in this  area  has  no
                         immediate  effect  except  to  cause the
                         slider  to  appear  sunken  rather  than
                         raised.   However, if the mouse is moved
                         with the button  down  then  the  slider
                         will  be  dragged, adjusting the view as
                         the mouse is moved.

     bboottttoomm ggaapp          Causes the view in the associated window
                         to  shift  down  by  one  less  than the

scrollbar                 User Commands                 scrollbar



                         number of units in the window (i.e.  the
                         portion  of  the  object  that  used  to
                         appear at the very bottom of the  window
                         will  now  appear  at the very top).  If
                         the button is held down the action  will
                         auto-repeat.

     bboottttoomm aarrrrooww        Causes the view in the associated window
                         to  shift  down  by  one  unit (i.e. the
                         object appears to move up  one  unit  in
                         its window).  If the button is held down
                         the action will auto-repeat.

     Note:  none of the actions described above has an  immediate
     impact  on  the position of the slider in the scrollbar.  It
     simply invokes the command specified in the  ccoommmmaanndd  option
     to  notify  the  associated  widget that a change in view is
     desired.  If the view is actually changed then  the  associ-
     ated  widget  must invoke the scrollbar's sseett widget command
     to change what is displayed in the scrollbar.
