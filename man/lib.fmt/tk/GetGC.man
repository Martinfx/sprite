     TTkk__GGeettGGCC and TTkk__FFrreeeeGGCC manage a collection of graphics  con-
     texts  being  used  by an application.  The procedures allow
     graphics contexts to be shared, thereby avoiding the  server
     overhead  that  would  be  incurred  if  a  separate GC were
     created for each use.  TTkk__GGeettGGCC takes  arguments  describing
     the desired graphics context and returns an X identifier for
     a GC that fits the description.  The graphics  context  that
     is  returned  will  have default values in all of the fields
     not specified explicitly by _v_a_l_u_e_M_a_s_k and _v_a_l_u_e_P_t_r.

     TTkk__GGeettGGCC and TTkk__GGeettGGCCFFrroommDDaattaa maintain a database of all the
     graphics  contexts  they have created.  Whenever possible, a
     call to TTkk__GGeettGGCC or TTkk__GGeettGGCCFFrroommDDaattaa will return an existing
     graphics  context  rather  than  creating  a  new one.  This
     approach  can  substantially  reduce  server  overhead,   so

     TTkk__GGeettGGCC  should generally be used in preference to the Xlib
     procedure XXCCrreeaatteeGGCC, which creates a new graphics context on
     each call.

     Since the return values  of  TTkk__GGeettGGCC  are  shared,  callers
     should  never  modify  the  graphics  contexts  returned  by
     TTkk__GGeettGGCC.  If a graphics context must  be  modified  dynami-
     cally,  then  it  should  be  created  by  calling XXCCrreeaatteeGGCC
     instead of TTkk__GGeettGGCC.

     When a graphics  context  is  no  longer  needed,  TTkk__FFrreeeeGGCC
     should be called to release it.  There should be exactly one
     call to TTkk__FFrreeeeGGCC for each call to TTkk__GGeettGGCC.  When a  graph-
     ics  context  is no longer in use anywhere (i.e. it has been
     freed as many times as it has been  gotten)  TTkk__FFrreeeeGGCC  will
     release it to the X server and delete it from the database.
