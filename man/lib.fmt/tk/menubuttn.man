          Specifies  a  desired height for the menu button.  If a  |
          bitmap is being displayed in the menu button  then  the  |
          value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accept-  |
          able to TTkk__GGeettPPiixxeellss); for text it is in lines of text.  |
          If  this  option  isn't  specified,  the  menu button's  |
          desired height is computed from the size of the  bitmap  |
          or text being displayed in it.

     Command-Line Switch:--ssttaattee

          Specifies one of three  states  for  the  menu  button:
          nnoorrmmaall,  aaccttiivvee, or ddiissaabblleedd.  In normal state the menu
          button is displayed using the ffoorreeggrroouunndd and bbaacckkggrroouunndd
          options.   The  active state is typically used when the
          pointer is over the menu button.  In active  state  the
          menu button is displayed using the aaccttiivveeFFoorreeggrroouunndd and
          aaccttiivveeBBaacckkggrroouunndd options.  Disabled  state  means  that
          the  menu  button  is insensitive:  it doesn't activate
          and doesn't respond to mouse button presses.   In  this
          state  the  ddiissaabblleeddFFoorreeggrroouunndd  and  bbaacckkggrroouunndd options

          Specifies the name of a global variable to set whenever
          this menubutton posts its menu.  Also serves as name of
          group of  related  menubuttons  (allows  event  sharing

          Specifies  a  desired  width for the menu button.  If a  |
          bitmap is being displayed in the menu button  then  the  |
          value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accept-  |
          able to TTkk__GGeettPPiixxeellss); for text it  is  in  characters.  |
          If  this  option  isn't  specified,  the  menu button's  |
          desired width is computed from the size of  the  bitmap  |
          or text being displayed in it.

     The mmeennuubbuuttttoonn command creates a new window  (given  by  the
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e  argument)  and  makes it into a menubutton widget.
     Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the menubutton such as its colors, font, text,  and  ini-
     tial  relief.   The  mmeennuubbuuttttoonn command returns its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
     argument.  At the time this command is invoked,  there  must
     not  exist  a  window  named _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent
     must exist.

     A menubutton is a widget that displays a textual  string  or  |
     bitmap  and  is  associated  with  a menu widget.  In normal
     usage, pressing mouse button 1 over  the  menubutton  causes
     the  associated  menu to be posted just underneath the menu-
     button.  If the mouse is moved over the menu before  releas-
     ing the mouse button, the button release causes the underly-
     ing menu entry to be invoked.  When the button is  released,
     the menu is unposted.

     Menubuttons are organized into groups to  allow  menu  scan-
     ning:  if  the  mouse  button is pressed over one menubutton
     (causing it to post its menu) and the mouse  is  moved  over
     another  menubutton  in the same group without releasing the
     mouse button, then the  menu  of  the  first  menubutton  is

     unposted  and  the  menu  of  the  new  menubutton is posted
     instead.  This makes it possible to scan a row of  pull-down
     menus  to  find  a  particular entry.  Typically, all of the
     menubuttons for an application are in the same group, but it
     is possible to assign multiple groups:  this allows scanning
     within a group but not between them.

     Each menubutton is associated with a particular global vari-
     able,  determined  by  the vvaarriiaabbllee option, and the variable
     determines the menubutton's group:  all menubuttons with the
     same  associated variable are in the same group.  Whenever a
     menubutton posts its menu it stores the  path  name  of  the  |
     menubutton  in  the  associated  variable.  Furthermore, the  |
     menubutton monitors the value of that variable continuously.  |
     When  the  variable  changes  value (e.g. because some other  |
     menubutton posted its menu) then the menubutton will  unpost  |
     its menu if the new value is different than the menubutton's  |
     name or post its menu if the new value is the  same  as  the  |
     menubutton's  name.   This  means you can cause a menu to be  |
     posted or unposted just by changing the value of  the  vari-  |
     able.

     The mmeennuubbuuttttoonn command creates a new Tcl command whose  name
     is  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.   This  command  may be used to invoke various
     operations on the widget.   It  has  the  following  general
     form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n ?_a_r_g _a_r_g ...?
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and the _a_r_gs determine the exact behavior of the com-
     mand.   The  following  commands are possible for menubutton
     widgets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e aaccttiivvaattee
          Change the menu button's state to aaccttiivvee and  redisplay
          the  menu  button using its active foreground and back-
          ground colors instead of normal  colors.   The  command
          returns  an  empty  string.  This command is ignored if  |
          the menu button's state is ddiissaabblleedd.  This  command  is  |
          obsolete and will eventually be removed; use ``_p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e  |
          ccoonnffiigguurree --ssttaattee aaccttiivvee'' instead.

          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is

          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the mmeennuubbuuttttoonn command.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeeaaccttiivvaattee
          Change the menu button's state to nnoorrmmaall and  redisplay
          the  menu  button using its normal foreground and back-
          ground colors.  The command returns  an  empty  string.  |
          This  command  is ignored if the menu button's state is  |
          ddiissaabblleedd.  This command is obsolete and will eventually  |
          be  removed;  use  ``_p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree --ssttaattee nnoorrmmaall''  |
          instead.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ppoosstt
          Arrange for the  menubutton's  associated  menu  to  be
          posted.   This  is done by executing a Tcl command with
          the form

                    _m_e_n_u ppoosstt _x _y _g_r_o_u_p

          where _m_e_n_u is the path name of the associated  menu,  _x
          and _y are the root-window coordinates of the lower-left
          corner of the menubutton, and _g_r_o_u_p is the name of  the
          menubutton's  group  (its  vvaarriiaabbllee option).  As a side
          effect, the path name of the associated menu is  stored
          in  the global variable associated with the menubutton.
          Returns an empty string.  This command  is  ignored  if  |
          the menu button's state is ddiissaabblleedd.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e uunnppoosstt
          Store an empty string in the variable  associated  with
          the menubutton.  If the menubutton has posted its menu,
          this will cause it to unpost its menu  by  executing  a
          command of the form

                    _m_e_n_u uunnppoosstt

          where _m_e_n_u is the name of the associated menu.  If  any
          other  menubutton  sharing the same variable has posted
          its menu, then that menubutton will unpost its menu  in
          a similar fashion.  Returns an empty string.

          A  menu  button's  relief is changed to raised whenever  |
          mouse button 1 is pressed over it, and  the  relief  is  |
          restored  to  its original value when button 1 is later  |
          released or the mouse is dragged into another menu but-  |
          ton in the same group.                                   |

     [3]                                                                ||
          When  mouse  button 1 is pressed over a menu button, or  |
          when the mouse is dragged into a menu button with mouse  |
          button  1  pressed, the associated menu is posted;  the  |
          mouse can be dragged across the menu and released  over  |
          an entry in the menu to invoke that entry.  The menu is  |
          unposted when button 1 is released outside  either  the  |
          menu  or  the  menu  button.  The menu is also unposted  |
          when the mouse is dragged into another menu  button  in  |
          the same group.                                          |

          If  mouse  button  1 is pressed and released within the  |
          menu button, then the menu stays  posted  and  keyboard  |
          traversal  is possible as described in the manual entry  |
          for ttkk__mmeennuuss.                                            |

          Menubuttons  may also be posted by typing characters on  |
          the keyboard.  See the manual entry  for  ttkk__mmeennuuss  for  |
          full details on keyboard menu traversal.                 |

          If  mouse  button  2 is pressed over a menu button then  |
          the associated menu is posted and also  _t_o_r_n  _o_f_f:   it  |
          can  then be dragged around on the screen with button 2  |
          and the menu will not automatically unpost when entries  |
          in  it  are  invoked.   To close a torn off menu, click  |
          mouse button 1 over the associated menu button.          |

     If the menu button's state is  ddiissaabblleedd  then  none  of  the  |
     above  actions  occur:   the  menu button is completely non-  |
     responsive.                                                   |

     The behavior of menu buttons can be changed by defining  new  |
     bindings  for  individual widgets or by redefining the class  |
     bindings.
