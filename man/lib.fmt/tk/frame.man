     The ffrraammee command creates a new window (given by  the  _p_a_t_h_-
     _N_a_m_e argument) and makes it into a frame widget.  Additional
     options, described above, may be specified  on  the  command
     line  or  in the option database to configure aspects of the
     frame such as its background color and  relief.   The  ffrraammee
     command returns the path name of the new window.

     A frame is a simple widget.  Its primary purpose is  to  act
     as  a  spacer  or container for complex window layouts.  The
     only features of a frame are its  background  color  and  an
     optional  3-D  border  to  make  the  frame appear raised or
     sunken.

     In addition to the standard options listed above,  a  --ccllaassss
     option  may  be  specified  on  the  command line.  If it is
     specified, then the  new  widget's  class  will  be  set  to
     _c_l_a_s_s_N_a_m_e  instead  of FFrraammee.  Changing the class of a frame
     widget may be useful in order to use a special class name in
     database  options referring to this widget and its children.
     Note:  --ccllaassss is handled differently than other command-line
     options  and  cannot  be specified using the option database
     (it has to be processed before the other  options  are  even
     looked  up,  since the new class name will affect the lookup
     of the other options).  In addition, the --ccllaassss  option  may
     not be queried or changed using the ccoonnffiigg command described
     below.

     The ffrraammee command creates a new Tcl command  whose  name  is
     the  same  as  the  path  name  of the frame's window.  This

frame                     User Commands                     frame



     command may be used to  invoke  various  operations  on  the
     widget.  It has the following general form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n ?_a_r_g _a_r_g ...?
     _P_a_t_h_N_a_m_e is the name of the command, which is  the  same  as
     the frame widget's path name.  _O_p_t_i_o_n and the _a_r_gs determine
     the exact behavior of the command.  The  following  commands
     are possible for frame widgets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ccoonnffiigguurree ?_o_p_t_i_o_n? ?_v_a_l_u_e _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e ...?
          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the ffrraammee command.

     When a new frame is created, it has no default  event  bind-
     ings: frames are not intended to be interactive.
