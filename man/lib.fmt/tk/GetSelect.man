     TTkk__GGeettSSeelleeccttiioonn retrieves the selection in the format speci-
     fied  by _t_a_r_g_e_t.  The selection may actually be retrieved in
     several pieces;  as each piece is retrieved, _p_r_o_c is  called
     to process the piece.  _P_r_o_c should have arguments and result
     that match the type TTkk__GGeettSSeellPPrroocc:
          typedef int Tk_GetSelProc(
               ClientData _c_l_i_e_n_t_D_a_t_a,
               Tcl_Interp *_i_n_t_e_r_p,
               char *_p_o_r_t_i_o_n);
     The _c_l_i_e_n_t_D_a_t_a and _i_n_t_e_r_p parameters to _p_r_o_c will be  copies
     of  the corresponding arguments to TTkk__GGeettSSeelleeccttiioonn.  _P_o_r_t_i_o_n
     will be a pointer to a string containing part or all of  the
     selection.   For  large  selections,  _p_r_o_c  will  be  called
     several times with sucessive portions of the selection.  The
     X  Inter-Client  Communication Conventions Manual allows the
     selection to be returned in formats other than strings, e.g.

     as  an array of atoms or integers.  If this happens, Tk con-
     verts the selection back into a string before calling  _p_r_o_c.
     If  the  selection is returned as an array of atoms, Tk con-
     verts it to a string containing the atom names separated  by
     white  space.   For any other format besides string, Tk con-
     verts the  selection  to  a  string  containing  hexadecimal
     values separated by white space.

     TTkk__GGeettSSeelleeccttiioonn returns to its caller when the selection has
     been  completely  retrieved and processed by _p_r_o_c, or when a
     fatal error has occurred (e.g. the  selection  owner  didn't
     respond promptly).  TTkk__GGeettSSeelleeccttiioonn normally returns TCL_OK;
     if an error occurs, it returns TCL_ERROR and leaves an error
     message  in  _i_n_t_e_r_p->_r_e_s_u_l_t.  _P_r_o_c should also return either
     TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR. If _p_r_o_c encounters an error in  dealing
     with  the  selection,  it  should  leave an error message in
     _i_n_t_e_r_p->_r_e_s_u_l_t and return TCL_ERROR;  this  will  abort  the
     selection retrieval.
