DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     TTkk__CCrreeaatteeSSeellHHaannddlleerr  arranges  for  a  particular  procedure
     (_p_r_o_c) to be called whenever the selection is owned by _t_k_w_i_n
     and the selection contents are requested in the  form  given
     by  _t_a_r_g_e_t.   _T_a_r_g_e_t should be one of the entries defined in
     the left column of Table 2 of the X Inter-Client  Communica-
     tion  Conventions  Manual (ICCCM) or any other form in which
     an application is willing to  present  the  selection.   The
     most common form is STRING.

     _P_r_o_c should have arguments and result that  match  the  type
     TTkk__SSeelleeccttiioonnPPrroocc:
          typedef int Tk_SelectionProc(
               ClientData _c_l_i_e_n_t_D_a_t_a,
               int _o_f_f_s_e_t,
               char *_b_u_f_f_e_r,
               int _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s);
     The _c_l_i_e_n_t_D_a_t_a parameter to _p_r_o_c is a copy of the _c_l_i_e_n_t_D_a_t_a
     argument  given  to TTkk__CCrreeaatteeSSeellHHaannddlleerr.  Typically, _c_l_i_e_n_t_-
     _D_a_t_a points to  a  data  structure  containing  application-
     specific  information  that is needed to retrieve the selec-
     tion.  _O_f_f_s_e_t specifies an offset position into  the  selec-
     tion,  _b_u_f_f_e_r specifies a location at which to copy informa-
     tion about the selection, and _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s specifies the  amount
     of  space  available  at  _b_u_f_f_e_r.  _P_r_o_c should place a NULL-
     terminated string at _b_u_f_f_e_r  containing  _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s  or  fewer
     characters  (not  including  the  terminating  NULL), and it
     should return a count of the number of  non-NULL  characters
     stored  at  _b_u_f_f_e_r.  If the selection no longer exists (e.g.
     it once existed but the user deleted the range of characters
     containing it), then _p_r_o_c should return -1.

     When transferring large selections, Tk will  break  them  up
     into  smaller  pieces  (typically a few thousand bytes each)
     for more efficient transmision.  It will do this by  calling
     _p_r_o_c  one or more times, using successively higher values of
     _o_f_f_s_e_t to retrieve successive portions of the selection.  If
     _p_r_o_c  returns  a  count less than _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s it means that the
     entire remainder of the selection  has  been  returned.   If
     _p_r_o_c's  return value is _m_a_x_B_y_t_e_s it means there may be addi-
     tional information in the selection, so Tk must make another
     call to _p_r_o_c to retrieve the next portion.

     _P_r_o_c always returns selection information in the form  of  a
     character string.  However, the ICCCM allows for information
     to be transmitted from the selection owner to the  selection
     requestor  in  any  of several formats, such as a string, an
     array of atoms, an array of integers, etc.  The _f_o_r_m_a_t argu-
     ment  to TTkk__CCrreeaatteeSSeellHHaannddlleerr indicates what format should be
     used to transmit the selection to  its  requestor  (see  the
     middle  column  of  Table  2 of the ICCCM for examples).  If
     _f_o_r_m_a_t is not STRING, then Tk will take the  value  returned

     by _p_r_o_c and divided it into fields separated by white space.
     If _f_o_r_m_a_t is ATOM, then Tk will return the selection  as  an
     array  of atoms, with each field in _p_r_o_c's result treated as
     the name of one atom.  For any other  value  of  _f_o_r_m_a_t,  Tk
     will return the selection as an array of 32-bit values where
     each field of _p_r_o_c's result  is  treated  as  a  number  and
     translated to a 32-bit value.  In any event, the _f_o_r_m_a_t atom
     is returned to the selection requestor along with  the  con-
     tents of the selection.

     At present there is no way to  delete  a  selection  handler
     except  by  deleting the window with which it is associated.
     However, if TTkk__CCrreeaatteeSSeellHHaannddlleerr is called when there already
     exists  a  handler  for  _t_a_r_g_e_t  on _t_k_w_i_n, then the existing
     handler is replaced with a new one.
