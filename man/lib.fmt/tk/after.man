     This command is used to delay execution of the program or to
     execute a command in background after a delay.  The _m_s argu-
     ment gives a time in milliseconds.  If _m_s is the only  argu-
     ment  to  aafftteerr  then the command sleeps for _m_s milliseconds
     and returns.  While the command is sleeping the  application  |
     still responds to X events and other events.

     If additional arguments are present after  _m_s,  then  a  Tcl
     command  is formed by concatenating all the additional argu-
     ments in the same fashion  as  the  ccoonnccaatt  command.   AAfftteerr
     returns  immediately but arranges for the command to be exe-
     cuted _m_s milliseconds later in background.  The command will  |
     be  executed at global level (outside the context of any Tcl  |
     procedure).  If an error occurs while executing the  delayed
     command  then  the  ttkkeerrrroorr  mechanism is used to report the
     error.

     The aafftteerr command always returns an empty string.
