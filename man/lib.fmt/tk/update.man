     This command is used to bring the entire  application  world
     ``up  to  date.''  It  flushes  all  pending  output  to the
     display,  waits for the server to process  that  output  and
     return  errors  or events, handles all pending events of any
     sort (including when-idle handlers), and repeats this set of
     operations  until  there  are  no pending events, no pending
     when-idle handlers, no pending output to the server, and  no
     operations still outstanding at the server.

     This command is useful in scripts or other places  where  it
     is  desired  that  all  operations  issued  so far have been
     reflected on the display and in the application's state.
