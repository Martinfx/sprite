     The cchheecckkbbuuttttoonn command creates a new window (given  by  the
     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e  argument) and makes it into a check-button widget.
     Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the check button such as its colors, font, text, and ini-
     tial  relief.   The cchheecckkbbuuttttoonn command returns its _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
     argument.  At the time this command is invoked,  there  must
     not  exist  a  window  named _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e, but _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e's parent
     must exist.

     A check button is a widget that displays  a  textual  string
     and  a  square called a _s_e_l_e_c_t_o_r.  A check button has all of
     the behavior of a simple button, including the following: it
     can   display   itself  in  either  of  two  color  schemes,
     ``active'' or ``normal'';  it can be made to appear  raised,
     sunken,  or  flat; it can be made to flash; and it invokes a
     Tcl command whenever mouse button  1  is  clicked  over  the
     check  button.  In addition, it can be _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d.  If a check
     button is selected then a special highlight appears  in  the
     selector,  and a Tcl variable associated with the check but-
     ton is set to a particular value (normally 1).  If the check
     button is not selected, then the selector is drawn in a dif-
     ferent fashion and the associated variable is set to a  dif-
     ferent  value  (typically  0).   By default, the name of the
     variable associated with a check button is the same  as  the
     _n_a_m_e  used  to  create the check button.  The variable name,
     and the ``on'' and ``off'' values stored in it, may be modi-
     fied with options on the command line or in the option data-
     base.  By default a check button is configured to select and
     deselect itself on alternate button clicks.

     The cchheecckkbbuuttttoonn command creates a new Tcl command whose name
     is  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e.   This  command  may be used to invoke various
     operations on the widget.   It  has  the  following  general
     form:

          _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n [_a_r_g]
     _O_p_t_i_o_n and _a_r_g determine the exact behavior of the  command.
     The  following  commands are possible for check-button widg-
     ets:

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e aaccttiivvaattee
          Redisplay the check button using its active  foreground
          and background colors instead of normal colors.

          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.   If  no  _o_p_t_i_o_n  is  specified, returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e
          (see  TTkk__CCoonnffiigguurreeIInnffoo for information on the format of
          this list).  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is specified with no _v_a_l_u_e, then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no _o_p_t_i_o_n is
          specified).  If one  or  more  _o_p_t_i_o_n-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
          command  returns  an empty string.  _O_p_t_i_o_n may have any
          of the values accepted by the cchheecckkbbuuttttoonn command.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeeaaccttiivvaattee
          Redisplay the check button using its normal  foreground
          and background colors instead of active colors.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ddeesseelleecctt
          Deselect the check  button:   redisplay  it  without  a
          highlight  in the selector and set the associated vari-
          able to its ``off'' value.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ffllaasshh
          Flash  the  check  button.   This  is  accomplished  by
          redisplaying  the check button several times, alternat-
          ing between active and normal colors.  At  the  end  of
          the  flash  the  check  button  is  left  in  the  same
          normal/active state as when the command was invoked.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e iinnvvookkee
          Does just what would have happened if the user  invoked  |
          the  check  button with the mouse: toggle the selection  |
          state of the button and invoke the Tcl command  associ-  |
          ated  with  the  check  button,  if  there is one.  The  |
          return value is the return value from the Tcl  command,  |
          or  an  empty  string if there is no command associated  |
          with the check button.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e sseelleecctt
          Select the check button:  display it with a highlighted
          selector  and set the associated variable to its ``on''
          value.

     _p_a_t_h_N_a_m_e ttooggggllee
          Toggle the selection state of the button,  redisplaying
          it and modifying its associated variable to reflect the
          new state.

BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
     When a new check button is created, it is given the  follow-
     ing initial behavior by default:

     <<EEnntteerr>>             Activate.

     <<LLeeaavvee>>             Deactivate.

     <<BBuuttttoonnPPrreessss--11>>     Change relief to sunken.

     <<BBuuttttoonnRReelleeaassee--11>>   Change relief to raised.  If the release
                         occurred  over  the  area  of the button
                         window, then toggle the  check  button's
                         selection  state and invoke the button's
                         command (if there is one).  If the mouse
                         left  the button window before releasing
                         the mouse button, then don't change  the
                         selection  state  or invoke the button's
                         command.
