     JJssttaatt reports the state of various Jaquith information.


     The status of all the physical devices can be obtained  with
     the  --ddeevviicceess  option.  The  status  of the jukebox's client
     queue can be obtained with --qquueeuueess. A list  of  the  logical
     archives  known  to  Jaquith can be obtained with --aarrcchhlliisstt.
     At least one of the options must be given.


     For the --ddeevviicceess and --qquueeuueess options, a jukebox manager must
     be  specified.  Strangely  enough this is done by giving the
     name of a  logical  archive,  not  the  name  of  a  jukebox
     manager.   Jaquith  will  look  up  the  jmgr  for the given
     archive and contact it for the device or queue information.


     For each device being controlled by the jukebox manager  the
     following is listed:

          _d_e_v_i_c_e-_n_a_m_e _c_u_r_r_e_n_t-_v_o_l_u_m_e _c_u_r_r_e_n_t-_o_w_n_e_r

     The status of the client queue  can  be  obtained  with  the
     --qquueeuueess option. The following is given for each waiter:


          _r_e_q_u_e_s_t_o_r-_n_a_m_e _d_e_s_i_r_e_d-_v_o_l_u_m_e

     The queue information is for devices only; Clients which are
     waiting for write access to a logical archive (and therefore
     don't yet know what device they need) are not reported.
