     _Z_l_o_c_a_t_e uses the _Z_e_p_h_y_r(_1) Notification Service to find
     where a user is currently logged in.  If the user is not
     logged in, or has set his location information such that you
     do not have access to see it, _z_l_o_c_a_t_e prints "Hidden or not
     logged-in".  Otherwise, each machine that the user is
     currently logged into is printed, along with the time of
     login and location.  The location is usually the X window
     system display name of the user's display, but may be the
     terminal name if he is not using X or for some other reason
     is only using the terminal interface to _z_w_g_c(_1).

     By default, all zlocate requests are authenticated using
     _K_e_r_b_e_r_o_s.  If you do not have kerberos tickets, or for some
     other reason do not want to authenticate, the --dd option will
     turn off authentication.  The --aa option is the default,
     authentication on.

     _z_l_o_c_a_t_e exits with status zero (0) if at least one user was
     found, and one (1) if no users were found.
