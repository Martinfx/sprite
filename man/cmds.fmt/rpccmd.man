     rpccmd - Control the RPC system

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     --oonn           Turn on the server half of the RPC system.

     --ooffff          Turn off the server half of the RPC system.

     --ppiinngg _h_o_s_t    Do an RPC test against the specified host.

     --bb _s_i_z_e       The amount of data to send in each RPC test.

     --tt [00||11]      Set the value  of  the  rpc_Tracing  variable.
                   RPC  tracing  facilitates  debugging, but adds
                   overhead to each RPC.

     --DD [00||11]      Set the value of the  rpc_Debug  variable.   A
                   non-zero value causes each RPC to be logged to
                   /dev/syslog.  This really slows things down!

     --TT [00||11]      Set the value of the rpc_NoTimeouts  variable.
                   A  non-zero  value makes all RPCs try forever.
                   This is dangerous because a  server  call-back
                   to a dead client will hang the server.

     --CC [00||11]      Turn off/on timings of RPC on the client side.
                   Use  rrppccssttaatt  to  dump  out  the histograms of
                   times that are taken by the kernel.

     --SS [00||11]      Turn off/on timing of the RPC service times as
                   measured by the server.

     --CCrreesseett       Reset the client-side timing histograms.

     --SSrreesseett       Reset the server-side timing histograms.

     --mmaaxxSSeerrvveerrss _n_u_m_b_e_r
                   Set the maximum number of allowed  rpc  server
                   processes.

     --nnuummSSeerrvveerrss _n_u_m_b_e_r
                   Create more  rpc  servers  until  this  number
                   exists.

     --nneeggAAcckkssOOnn    Allow the machine to  generate  negative  ack-
                   nowledgements.

     --nneeggAAcckkssOOffff   Prevent the machine from  generating  negative
                   acknowledgements.

     --cchhaannnneellNNeeggAAcckkssOOnn
                   Turn on the client policy of ramping down  the
                   number  of channels it uses with a server that
                   has  returned   a   negative   acknowledgement
                   recently.

     --cchhaannnneellNNeeggAAcckkssOOffff
                   Turn off the client policy of ramping down the
                   number  of channels it uses with a server that
                   has  returned   a   negative   acknowledgement
                   recently.  Use back-off instead.

     --nnuummPPiinnggss     Number of pings to send to the specified  host
                   (defaults to 100).

     --ssaanniittyy [00||11] Turn off/on sanity checking  of  RPC  packets.
                   The  types  of sanity checks done are intended
                   for debugging purposes and probably  shouldn't
                   be used during normal operation.

     This command is used to set various  control  parameters  of
     the RPC system.  The most important is the --oonn option, which
     is used during the boot sequence to enable RPC service after
     local  initialization (i.e. disk checks) is done.  The --ppiinngg
     option is used to ping another sprite host.  This is  useful
     to  find  out  if the host is up, and the make sure that the
     host knows you are alive.  This does an  RPC_SEND,  and  the
     amount of data sent can be specified with the --bb option.

     Each of the --tt, --DD, --TT, --CC, and --SS options set the value  of
     a  kernel  variable.  --tt is used to turn on or off the trace
     of the last 100 RPC packets.  --DD is used to turn on  or  off
     debugging  print  statements.   --TT is used to turn on or off
     "no timeout mode".  This mode is  useful  when  debugging  a
     client  and  you  don't want the server to timeout and think
     the client has crashed.  It is dangerous,  however,  because
     if the server ever makes a call-back to a truely dead client
     it will hang until the no timeout mode is turned off.

     The --CC and --SS options turn on or off timings  of  individual
     RPCs.   --CC  controls  timing on the client side, and --SS con-
     trols timing on the server side.  The timings  are  kept  in
     histogram form.  Use the --CCrreesseett and --SSrreesseett options to zero
     out the histograms.  Use rrppccssttaatt to display them.
