     _M_k_i_d builds a database that stores numbers and identifier
     names, as well as the names of the files in which they
     occur.  _M_k_i_d is particularly useful with large programs
     spread out across multiple source files.  It serves as an
     aid for program maintenance and as a _g_u_i_d_e for perusing a
     program.

     The following options are recognized:

     --vv        Verbose.  Report _m_k_i_d's progress in building the
               database.  The output comes on standard error.

     --ff_o_u_t-_f_i_l_e
               Write the finished database into _o_u_t-_f_i_l_e.  IIDD is
               the default.

     --ss_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

     --rr_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
               If _m_k_i_d's attempt to open a source-file fails, it
               will try to checkout the corresponding SCCS or RCS
               file if present.  The --ss option tells _m_k_i_d which
               directory holds the SCCS file.  Similarly, the --rr
               option tells _m_k_i_d which directory holds the RCS
               file.  If neither the RCS or SCCS directories are
               specified, _m_k_i_d will first look for an SCCS file
               in the current directory, then in ssccccss, and
               finally in SSCCCCSS.  It will then look for an RCS
               file in the current directory, and finally in RRCCSS.

     --aa_a_r_g-_f_i_l_e
               Open and read _a_r_g-_f_i_l_e in order to obtain a list
               of source file arguments.  Source file names must
               appear one to a line.  --SS, --rr, and --ss arguments
               may also be placed one per line in _f_i_l_e.  They are
               distinguished from source file names by their
               leading `-'.  If a file name begins with `-', it
               can be distinguished from an argument by expli-
               citly prepending the current directory string:
               `./'.

     --         This operates in the same manner as the --aa option
               described above, but reads from the standard input
               instead of a file.

     --uu        Update an existing database.  Only those files
               that have been modified since the database was
               built will be rescanned.  This is a significant
               time-saver for updating large databases where few
               sources have changed.

     ffiilleess......  If neither the --aa, --, nor --uu, arguments have been
               specified, take file names from the command line.

     --SS_s_c_a_n_a_r_g _M_k_i_d scans source files in order to obtain numbers
               and identifier names.  Since the lexical rules of
               languages differ, _m_k_i_d applies a different scan-
               ning function to each language in order to conform
               to that language's lexical rules.  _M_k_i_d determines
               the source file's language by examining its
               filename suffix which commonly occurs after a dot
               (`.').  The --SS argument is a way of passing
               language specific arguments to the scanner for
               that language.  This argument takes a number of
               forms:
               -S<suffix>=<language>
               -S<language>-<arg>
               +S-<arg>
               The first form associates a suffix with a
               language.  You may find out which suffixes are
               defined for which languages with the following
               options: `-S<suffix>=?' tells which language is
               bound to <_s_u_f_f_i_x>, `-S?=<language>' tells which
               suffixes are bound to <_l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e>, and `-S?=?'
               reports all bindings between suffixes and
               languages.

     The second form passes an argument for processing by the
     scanner for a specific language.  The third form passes an
     argument to all scanners.

     You may get a brief summary of the scanner-specific options
     for a language by supplying the following option: `-
     S<language>?'.

     Here is a brief summary of the options for the `_a_s_m' (assem-
     bler) language.

     The --uu option controls whether or not the assembler scanner
     should strip off a leading _u_n_d_e_r_s_c_o_r_e (`_') character.  If
     your assembler prepends an _u_n_d_e_r_s_c_o_r_e to external symbols,
     then you should tell the scanner to strip it off, so that
     references to the same symbol from assembly and from a
     high-level language will look the same.

     The --cc<<cccc>> option supplies the character(s) used to begin a
     comment that extends to the end of the line.

     The --aa<<cccc>> option indicates character(s) that are legal in
     names, in addition to the alpha-numeric characters.  If the
     option appears as `-a', names that contain these characters
     are ignored.  If it appears as `+a', these names are added
     to the database.

     This manual page needs to be more complete about the
     scanner-specific arguments.

     At the moment, the only scanners implemented are for C and
     assembly language.  There ought to be scanners for Ada, Pas-
     cal, Fortran, Lisp, nroff/troff, and TeX.
