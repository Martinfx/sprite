DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The program ddvviippss converts a DVI file _f_i_l_e[.dvi] produced by
     TeX (or by some other processor like GFtoDVI) and converts
     it to POSTSCRIPT, normally sending the result directly to
     the laserprinter.  The DVI file may be specified without the
     ._d_v_i extension.  Fonts used may either be resident in the
     printer or defined as bitmaps in PK files, or a `virtual'
     combination of both.  If the MMaakkeeTTeeXXPPKK program is installed,
     ddvviippss will automatically invoke METAFONT to generate fonts
     that don't already exist.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     Boolean flags that are turned on by certain letters (such as
     -r to reverse pages) can be turned off by following the
     option immediately with a 0 (as in -r0).  The options that
     this can be used with are ffmmqqrrFFKKNNUUZZ.  The command line
     switches are:

     --cc _n_u_m
          Generate _n_u_m copies of every page.  Default is 1. (For
          collated copies, see the --CC option below.)

     --dd _n_u_m
          Set the debug flags.  This is intended only for emer-
          gencies or for unusual fact-finding expeditions; it
          will work only if ddvviippss has been compiled with the
          DEBUG option.  The file _d_e_b_u_g._h in the sources indi-
          cates what the values of _n_u_m can be.  Use a value of -1
          for maximum output.

     --ee _n_u_m
          Make sure that each character is placed at most this
          many pixels from its `true' resolution-independent
          position on the page. The default value of this parame-
          ter is resolution dependent (it is the number of
          entries in the list [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800,
          1000, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400, 2800, 3200, ...] that are
          less than or equal to the resolution in dots per inch).
          Allowing individual characters to `drift' from their
          correctly rounded positions by a few pixels, while
          regaining the true position at the beginning of each
          new word, improves the spacing of letters in words.

     --ff   Run as a filter.  Read the DVI file from standard input
          and write the POSTSCRIPT to standard output.  The stan-
          dard input must be seekable, so it cannot be a pipe.
          If you must use a pipe, write a shell script that
          copies the pipe output to a temporary file and then
          points dvips at this file.

     --hh _n_a_m_e
          Prepend file _n_a_m_e as an additional header file. (How-
          ever, if the name is simply `-', suppress all header
          files from the output.)  This header file gets added to
          the POSTSCRIPT userdict.

     --ll _n_u_m
          The last page printed will be the first one numbered
          _n_u_m. Default is the last page in the document.

     --mm   Specify manual feed for printer.

     --nn _n_u_m
          At most _n_u_m pages will be printed out.  Default is
          100000.

     --oo _n_a_m_e
          The output will be sent to file _n_a_m_e. If no file name
          is given, the default name is _f_i_l_e.ps; if this option
          isn't given, the default name is !lpr.  If the first
          character of the file name is an exclamation mark, then
          the remainder will be used as an argument to popen;
          thus, specifying !lpr as the output file will automati-
          cally queue the file for printing.

     --pp _n_u_m
          The first page printed will be the first one numbered
          _n_u_m. Default is the first page in the document.

     --qq   Run in quiet mode.  Don't chatter about pages con-
          verted, etc.; report nothing but errors to stderr.

     --rr   Stack pages in reverse order.  Normally, page one will
          be printed first.

     --ss   Causes the entire global output to be enclosed in a
          save/restore pair.  This causes the file to not be
          truly conformant, and is thus not recommended, but is
          useful if you are driving the printer directly and
          don't care too much about the portability of the out-
          put.

     --tt _m_o_d_e_n_a_m_e
          This sets the mode to _m_o_d_e_n_a_m_e.  Currently, the only
          modes allowable are: lleetttteerr, which selects _l_e_t_t_e_r size

          (8.5 by 11 inch page); aa33, which selects _a_3 size; aa44,
          which selects _a_4 size; lleeggaall, which selects _l_e_g_a_l size
          (8.5 by 14 inches); lleeddggeerr, which selects _l_e_g_a_l size
          (11 by 17 inches); llaannddssccaappee, which rotates the docu-
          ment by ninety degrees.  The default page size is
          _l_e_t_t_e_r.  The llaannddssccaappee option may be combined with any
          of the others; doing so requires giving the --tt option
          twice.  The upper left corner of each page in the DVI
          file is placed one inch from the left and one inch from
          the top.

     --xx _n_u_m
          Set the magnification ratio to _n_u_m /1000. Overrides the
          magnification specified in the DVI file.  Must be
          between 10 and 100000.

     --CC _n_u_m
          Create _n_u_m copies, but collated (by replicating the
          data in the POSTSCRIPT file).  Slower than the --cc
          option, but easier on the humans.

     --DD _n_u_m
          Set the resolution in dpi (dots per inch) to _n_u_m. This
          affects the choice of bitmap fonts that are loaded and
          also the positioning of letters in resident POSTSCRIPT
          fonts. Must be between 10 and 10000.  This affects both
          the horizontal and vertical resolution.

     --FF   Causes control-D (ASCII code 4) to be appended as the
          very last character of the POSTSCRIPT file.  This is
          useful when ddvviippss is driving the printer directly, as
          is common on extremely small systems, instead of work-
          ing through a spooler.

     --KK   Removes comments from included graphics files.  Only
          necessary when using brain-damaged spoolers or
          POSTSCRIPT postprocessors that don't properly interpret
          structured comments.

     --MM   Turns off the automatic font generation capability.

     --NN   Turns off structured comments; this might be necessary
          on some systems that try to interpret POSTSCRIPT com-
          ments in weird ways, or on some POSTSCRIPT printers.

     --PP _p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e
          Sets up the output for the appropriate printer.  This
          is implemented by reading in _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e, which
          can then set the output pipe (as in, o !lpr -Pprinter-
          name) as well as the font paths and any other defaults
          for that printer only.  It is recommended that all
          standard defaults go in the one master _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_s file

          and only things that vary printer to printer go in the
          _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e files.  Note that _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_s is read
          before _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e. In addition, another file
          called ~/._d_v_i_p_s_r_c is searched for immediately after
          _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_s; this file is intended for user defaults.  If
          no --PP command is given, the environment variable
          PPRRIINNTTEERR is checked.  If that variable exists, and a
          corresponding _c_o_n_f_i_g.PPRRIINNTTEERR exists, then that confi-
          guration file is read in.

     --UU   Turns off a virtual memory saving optimization that
          triggers a bug in the Xerox 4045 POSTSCRIPT inter-
          preter; not recommended unless you must generate output
          to this printer.

     --XX _n_u_m
          Set the horizontal resolution in dpi (dots per inch) to
          _n_u_m.

     --YY _n_u_m
          Set the vertical resolution in dpi (dots per inch) to
          _n_u_m.

     --ZZ   Causes bitmap fonts to be compressed before they are
          downloaded, thereby reducing the size of the POSTSCRIPT
          font-downloading information.  Especially useful at
          high resolutions or when very large fonts are used.
          Will slow down printing somewhat, especially on early
          68000-based POSTSCRIPT printers.

     --??   Print out the banner identifying the program.

CCOONNFFIIGG FFIILLEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The file _c_o_n_f_i_g._p_s (and the user's own ~/._d_v_i_p_s_r_c) can be
     used to set many of the options to configure ddvviippss for a
     particular site and printer.  These will probably be set up
     by the installer, so normal users can skip this section.
     The name and location of the config file can be changed at
     installation time.  The environment variable TTEEXXCCOONNFFIIGG (if
     it exists) is used as the path to configuration files.  Each
     line of the file specifies a configuration option.  If the
     initial character is a space, an asterisk, a pound sign, or
     a semicolon, the line is ignored.  But if the initial char-
     acter is an option like "o", for example, the remainder of
     the line is considered to be a parameter.  The options are:

     ee _n_u_m
          Sets the maximum drift parameter to _n_u_m dots (pixels)
          as explained above.

     hh _n_a_m_e
          Add _n_a_m_e as a POSTSCRIPT header file to be downloaded
          at the beginning.

     mm _n_u_m
          _n_u_m is the virtual memory available for fonts and
          strings in the printer.  Default is 180000.

     oo _n_a_m_e
          The default output file is set to _n_a_m_e. As above, it
          can be a pipe.

     pp _n_a_m_e
          Sets the name of the file to read for PostScript font
          mapping.  This file name defaults to psfonts.map, but
          can be changed in the printer configuration file to
          allow different printers to have different sets of
          PostScript fonts.

     qq    Run in quiet mode by default.

     rr    Reverse the order of pages by default.

     ss    Enclose the entire document in a global save/restore
          pair by default.  Not recommended, but useful in some
          environments; this breaks the `conformance' of the
          document.

     tt _m_o_d_e_n_a_m_e
          This sets the mode to _m_o_d_e_n_a_m_e.  Currently, the only
          modes allowable are: lleetttteerr, which selects _l_e_t_t_e_r size
          (8.5 by 11 inch page); aa44, which selects _a_4 size;
          lleeggaall, which selects _l_e_g_a_l size (8.5 by 14 inches);
          llaannddssccaappee, which rotates a _l_e_t_t_e_r size document by
          ninety degrees.  The default mode is _l_e_t_t_e_r. The upper
          left corner of each page in the DVI file is placed one
          inch from the left and one inch from the top.  The --tt
          _m_o_d_e_n_a_m_e option will override this.

     DD _n_u_m
          Sets the vertical and horizontal resolution to _n_u_m dots
          per inch (dpi).

     EE _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
          Executes the command listed; can be used to get the
          current date into a header file for inclusion, for
          instance.  Possibly dangerous; in many installations
          this may be disabled, in which case a warning message
          will be printed if the option is used.

          header files is _p_a_t_h.

     KK    Removes POSTSCRIPT comments from included POSTSCRIPT
          graphics files.

     MM _m_o_d_e
          Set _m_o_d_e as the METAFONT mode to be used when generat-
          ing fonts.  This is passed along to MakeTeXPK and over-
          rides mode derivation from the base resolution.

     NN    Disable POSTSCRIPT comments by default.

     PP _p_a_t_h
          The (colon-separated) path to search for bitmap (PK)
          font files is _p_a_t_h. The TEXPKS environment variable
          will override this.  If a % character is found in _p_a_t_h,
          the following substitutions will be made, and then a
          search will be made for the resulting filenames.  A %f
          is replaced by the font name.  A %d is replaced by the
          font size in dots per inch (dpi).  A %p is replaced by
          the font family.  This is always "pk".  A %m is
          replaced by the font mode.  This is the _m_o_d_e given in
          the MM option.

     RR _n_u_m _n_u_m ...
          Sets up a list of default resolutions to search for PK
          fonts, if the requested size is not available.  The
          output will then scale the font found using POSTSCRIPT
          scaling to the requested size.  Note that the resultant
          output will be ugly, and thus a warning is issued.  To
          turn this off, simply don't use such a line in the con-
          figuration file.

     SS _p_a_t_h
          The (colon-separated) path to search for special illus-
          trations (encapsulated POSTSCRIPT files or psfiles) is
          _p_a_t_h. The TEXINPUTS environment variable will override
          this.

     TT _p_a_t_h
          The (colon-separated) path to search for the tfm files
          is _p_a_t_h. The TEXFONTS environment variable will over-
          ride this. This path is used for resident fonts and
          fonts that can't be otherwise found. It's usually best
          to make it identical to the path used by TeX.

     UU    Turns off a memory-saving optimization; see the command
          line option for more information.

     VV _p_a_t_h
          The (colon-separated) path to search for virtual font
          (VF) files is _p_a_t_h. This may be device-dependent, if

     WW _s_t_r_i_n_g
          Sends _s_t_r_i_n_g to stderr, if it exists; otherwise it can-
          cels another previous message.  This is useful in the
          default configuration file if you want to require the
          user to specify a printer, for instance, or if you want
          to notify the user that the resultant output has spe-
          cial characteristics.

     XX _n_u_m

     ments), separated by colons.  Each path element can be
     either the literal name of a directory or one of the ~ forms
     common under Unix.  If a path element is a single tilde, it
     is replaced by the contents of the environment variable
     HOME, which is normally set to the user's home directory.
     If the path element is a tilde followed by anything, the
     part after the tilde is interpreted as a user name, and his
     home directory is fetched from the system password file and
     used as the real path element.

     Where environment variables can override paths, an addi-
     tional path element form is allowed.  If a path element is
     the empty string, it is replaced with the system defaults.
     Thus, to say (with an environment variable) to search the
     user's home directory, followed by the system default paths,
     the following command would be used:

          setenv TEXINPUTS ~:

     This is a path of two elements.  The first is the user's
     home directory.  The second path element is the empty
     string, indicating that the system defaults should be
     searched.

     This version of dvips supports POSTSCRIPT fonts.  You need
     TFM (TeX Font Metric) files for all fonts seen by TeX; they
     can be generated from AFM (Adobe Font Metric) files by run-
     ning the program aaffmm22ttffmm (which is described on its own

     which you can use normal plain TeX conventions.  The set of
     all resident fonts known to ddvviippss appears in the file
     _p_s_f_o_n_t_s._m_a_p, which should be updated whenever you install a
     new resident font. See aaffmm22ttffmm for examples and more infor-

     This DVI driver allows the inclusion of POSTSCRIPT code to
     be inserted in a TeX file via TeX's \special command.  For
     compatibility with other systems, several different conven-
     tions are supported.

     First, there's a flexible key-and-value scheme:

          \special{psfile="filename"[ key=value]*}

     This will download the POSTSCRIPT file called _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e such
     that the current point will be the origin of the POSTSCRIPT
     coordinate system.  If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e string begins with the `
     (grave accent) character then the remainder of the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
     field is treated as a Unix Bourne shell script to be exe-
     cuted with its _s_y_s_o_u_t down loaded as a POSTSCRIPT file.  For
     example:

          \special{psfile="`zcat packed.ps" ...}

     will uncompress the file _p_a_c_k_e_d._p_s._Z for inclusion in ddvviippss
     output.

     The optional key/value assignments allow you to specify
     transformations on the POSTSCRIPT in _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e. The possible
     keys are:
          hoffset        The horizontal offset (default 0)
          voffset        The vertical offset (default 0)
          hsize          The horizontal clipping size (default 612)
          vsize          The vertical clipping size (default 792)
          hscale         The horizontal scaling factor (default 100)
          vscale         The vertical scaling factor (default 100)
          angle          The rotation (default 0)
     The hoffset, voffset, hsize, and vsize are given in
     POSTSCRIPT units (1/72 of an inch), called bp elsewhere in
     TeX; these are the units of the default coordinate system
     assumed to be valid in the POSTSCRIPT file.  The hscale and
     vscale are given in non-dimensioned percentage units, and
     the rotate value is specified in degrees.  Thus

          \special{psfile=foo.ps hoffset=72 hscale=90 vscale=90}

     will shift the graphics produced by file _f_o_o._p_s right by 1",
     and will draw it at 0.9 normal size.  If either hsize or
     vsize is specified, the figure will be clipped to a

     rectangular region from (0,0) to (hsize,vsize) in default
     coordinates, after scaling, translation, and/or rotation.
     Otherwise no clipping will be done.  Offsets are given rela-
     tive to the point of the \special command, and are unaf-
     fected by scaling or rotation. Rotation is counterclockwise
     about (0,0).  The order of operations is: Take the
     POSTSCRIPT figure, rotate it, then scale it, then offset it,
     then clip it. For example, if you want to extract a
     one-inch-square figure bounded by (100,200), (172,200),
     (172,272), and (100,272) in the POSTSCRIPT coordinates of
     the graphic in cropthis.ps, you would say

          \special{psfile=cropthis.ps
                    hoffset=-100 yoffset=-200
                    hsize=72 vsize=72}

     Secondly, if your file conforms to the _E_n_c_a_p_s_u_l_a_t_e_d _P_o_s_t
     _S_c_r_i_p_t (EPS) conventions, then it is possible to use a
     simpler \\ssppeecciiaall command that will automatically reserve the
     required space.

     To use, simply say

          \input epsf           % at the beginning of your TeX document
          \epsfbox{filename.ps} % at the place where you want the figure

     A _v_b_o_x of the appropriate size for the bounding box will be
     built. The height and width of this vbox will be the height
     and width of the figure; the depth of the vbox will be zero.
     By default, the graphic will have its `natural' width.  If
     you wish to enlarge or reduce it, simply set the dimension
     `\epsfxsize' to something else, such as `\hsize'; the figure
     will be scaled so that \epsfxsize is its final width.  A
     more general facility for sizing is available by defining
     the `\epsfsize' macro.  This macro is used to give \epsfx-
     size a value each time \epsffile is called.  It takes two
     parameters; the first is the horizontal natural size of the
     POSTSCRIPT figure, and the second is the vertical natural
     size.  (Natural size, in this case, is the size in
     POSTSCRIPT points from the bounding box comment.)  The
     default definition of this macro is

          \def\epsfsize#1#2{\epsfxsize}

     which just means to take the value that was set before the
     macro was invoked.  Note that the variable \epsfxsize is
     reset to zero at the end of each call to \epsffile.  You can
     redefine this macro to do almost anything.  It must return
     the xsize to use, or 0 if natural scaling is to be used.
     Common uses include:

          \epsfxsize  % just leave the old value alone

          0pt         % use the natural sizes
          #1          % use the natural sizes

     The resultant vbox can be centered with \centerline, or
     treated as any other vbox.  If you are using LaTeX and the
     center environment, be sure to execute a \leavevmode before
     each use of \epsffile, so that LaTeX leaves the vertical
     mode and enters the paragraph making mode.  (This should
     probably be provided by the LaTeX macros themselves.)

     (The \epsfbox macro does its job by scanning filename.ps for
     a standard `BoundingBox' comment. The figure is clipped to
     the size of that bounding box. If the bounding box is not
     found, a bounding box of `72 72 540 720' is assumed.  If the
     POSTSCRIPT file to be included is not EPSF, you are probably
     better off using the _p_s_f_i_l_e special instead.)

     Thirdly, there are special commands for drawing diagrams
     using the conventions of `TPIC' (a portable,
     non-POSTSCRIPT-dependent program by Tim Morgan, with
     POSTSCRIPT implementation by Dorab Patel). For example,
     `\special{pn 2}' in this language sets the pen size to .002
     inch.

     A fourth type of \special allows you to write POSTSCRIPT
     instructions that will be passed literally to dvips's output
     file. These are intended for people whose favorite graphics
     language is raw POSTSCRIPT.

          \special{" _t_e_x_t}

     includes _t_e_x_t literally in the output POSTSCRIPT document,
     after translating the origin to the current page position,
     opening a special user dictionary, and and reverting to the
     POSTSCRIPT convention of 72 units=1in.

          \special{! _t_e_x_t}

     includes _t_e_x_t literally in the prolog (before all typeset-
     ting is done), putting definitions in the special diction-
     ary; this is good for definitions you intend to use with
     \special{"}.  Note that _d_v_i_p_s will always include such spe-
     cials in the prolog, unless they occur on pages after the
     last page printed.  This allows correct printing of selected
     pages, even when literal POSTSCRIPT definitions are used,
     provided that you give definitions before their first use.

     A fifth type of \special allows literal POSTSCRIPT instruc-
     tions to be inserted _w_i_t_h_o_u_t enclosing them in an invisible

     protective shield; users of this feature are supposed to
     understand what they are doing (and they shouldn't change
     the POSTSCRIPT graphics state unless they are willing to
     take the consequences). This command can take many forms,
     because it has had a tortuous history; any of the following
     will work:

          \special{ps:_t_e_x_t}
          \special{ps::_t_e_x_t}
          \special{ps::[begin]_t_e_x_t}
          \special{ps::[end]_t_e_x_t}

     (with longer forms taking precedence over shorter forms,
     when they are used).  Exception: The command

          \special{ps: plotfile _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e}

     will copy the commands from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e verbatim into dvips's
     output (but omitting lines that begin with %).  An example
     of the proper use of literal specials can be found in the
     file rroottaattee..tteexx,, which makes it easy to typeset text turned
     90 degrees.

     Finally, there are two special cases of \special, which pro-
     vide alternatives to certain dvips command-line options: (1)
     You may put the command

          \\ssppeecciiaall{{llaannddssccaappee}}

     anywhere in your document (except after the final page
     selected for printing), and the entire document will be
     printed in landscape mode.  (2) The command

          \\ssppeecciiaall{{hheeaaddeerr==_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e}}

     may be used to add _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e as a header file (i.e., a file
     that will be downloaded before the start of processing).
     This is usually used for Macintosh header files.  The header
     file will be added to the POSTSCRIPT userdict.

     For special effects, if any of the macros _b_o_p-_h_o_o_k,
     _e_o_p-_h_o_o_k, _s_t_a_r_t-_h_o_o_k, or _e_n_d-_h_o_o_k are defined in the
     POSTSCRIPT userdict, they will be executed at the beginning
     of a page, end of a page, start of the document, and end of
     a document, respectively.  When these macros are executed,
     the default POSTSCRIPT coordinate system is in effect.  Such
     macros can be defined in headers added by the --hh option or
     the hheeaaddeerr== special, and might be useful for writing, for
     instance, DRAFT across the entire page, or, with the aid of
     a shell script, dating the document.  These macros are exe-
     cuted outside of the save/restore context of the individual
     pages, so it is possible for them to accumulate information,

     but if a document must be divided into sections because of
     memory constraints, such added information will be lost
     across section breaks.

     Several of the above tricks can be used nicely together.
     For instance, a --PP file can be set up to print the date on
     each page; the particular configuration file will execute a
     command to put the date into a header file, which is then
     included with a hh line in the configuration file.  Note that
     multiple --PP options can be used.

     If the filename in any of the POSTSCRIPT inclusion options
     begins with a backtick, that name is interpreted instead as
     a command to be executed to generate the appropriate file.
     The POSTSCRIPT must be generated to standard output by the
     command.  This is useful, for instance, for uncompressing
     large POSTSCRIPT files using zcat.
