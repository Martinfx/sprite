     Pnews is a friendly interface for posting news articles.  It
     will ask several questions, then allow you to enter your
     article, and then post it using the inews(1) program.  If
     you type h and a carriage return at any point, _P_n_e_w_s will
     tell you what it wants to know.

     The -h form is used when invoked from _r_n.  If your editor
     can edit multiple files, and you want the article to which
     you are replying to show up as an alternate file, define the
     environment variable NEWSPOSTER as "Pnews -h %h %A".  You
     can also modify the the NEWSHEADER environment variable to
     change the header file that _r_n passes to Pnews.
