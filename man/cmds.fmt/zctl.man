     _Z_c_t_l is a general purpose control program for the _Z_e_p_h_y_r(_1)
     Notification Service.  It allows the user to subscribe to
     specific notice types, to save the subscriptions in a file
     (default $HOME/.zephyr.subs), to change his location infor-
     mation, and to send control messages to the HostManager,
     _z_h_m(_8), and the WindowGram client, _z_w_g_c(_1).

     The commands may be typed on the command line, or may be
     entered interactively by just typing _z_c_t_l and then typing
     commands to the prompt.
     NNOOTTEE:: For all commands accepting an optional _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t argu-
     ment, the _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t defaults to your Kerberos principal.
     You may also subscribe to recipient ``*''.  If you specify a
     recipient, it is silently converted to ``*''.
     The commands are as follows:

     aadddd _c_l_a_s_s _i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e [ _r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t ]

                    add this triplet to the subscriptions file.

     to commands to specify the _c_l_a_s_s or _i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e fields.  A sam-
     ple $_H_O_M_E/._z_e_p_h_y_r._s_u_b_s file might contain the following:

     _Z_c_t_l reads the environment variable WWGGFFIILLEE, to find the name
     of the file where the windowgram port resides.  If WWGGFFIILLEE is

     The zephyr server, _z_e_p_h_y_r_d(_8), maintains default subscrip-
     tions which are automatically added to all users' subscrip-
     tions at the time of their first subscription during a login
     session.  If you wish to automatically remove some of these
     default subscriptions, you use uunn--ssuubbssccrriippttiioonnss.. When you
     llooaadd a subscription file containing un-subscriptions, the
     un-subscriptions are automatically sent to the server as if
