     _Z_n_o_l provides a way for you to be notified when "interest-
     ing" people log in or out.  It uses the _Z_e_p_h_y_r(_1) Notifica-
     tion Service, which causes a message to appear on your
     screen for every person specified in a namelist (which
     defaults to $HOME/.anyone).  The namelist should have one
     login name per line.  Any line starting with `#' is con-
     sidered a comment and ignored.  Anyone in the namelist who
     is logged in when _z_n_o_l is executed is printed to stdout.
     The control arguments are as follows:

     oonn||ooffff      Turns notification on or off.

     --ff          The namelist file is taken to be _f_i_l_e. If _f_i_l_e
                 is "-", then the standard input is used instead
                 of a file. If _f_i_l_e does not exist, an error mes-
                 sage is printed, and _z_n_o_l exits.  This option
                 may not be used in conjunction with the --uu
                 option.

     --ll          Causes _z_n_o_l to just list the people in the
                 namelist who are currently logged in, without
                 subscribing to the login messages.   This option
                 may not be used in conjunction with the --qq
                 option.

     --qq          Disables printing who is currently logged in
                 when subscribing.  This option may not be used
                 in conjunction with the --ll option.

     --uu          Instead of reading a file to specify the
                 "interesting" users, the next argument is used
                 as the only "interesting" user.  This option may
                 not be used in conjunction with the --ff option.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
          znol
     reads the standard namelist file, prints the locations of
     any users named therein which can be found on the system,
     and enters subscriptions for notices about those users.
          znol -l -u foo
     prints the location (if visible) of the user 'foo'.
