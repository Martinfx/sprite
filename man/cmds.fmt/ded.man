     Ded displays a long-form ls directory listing on the screen
     of a display terminal and allows you to 'edit' and peruse
     that listing by moving up and down it, deleting, editing,
     and displaying entries.  Normally the index is displayed in
     one window and file perusal done in the other.  With no
     string argument, the connected directory is used.  With one
     string argument, the argument is interpreted as a directory
     and it is used.  With multiple string arguments, they are
     interpreted as filenames.

     Options, which are inherited by recursive invocations of
     ded:

     --[[ssrr]][[ff||nn||ss||rr||ww||dd]]
          Sort or reverse sort by Filename, filename as Number,
          Size, Read date, Write date, or directory order (no
          sort) respectively.  "Normal sort" is the order you are
          most likely to desire, so is largest first for size,
          and most recent for read and write date sorts.  Default
          is to sort by filename.

     --ww[[ff||hh||NNuummbbeerr]]
          Use NNuummbbeerr lines for the directory index window,
          reserving the other half for quick file display.  ff
          means use the full screen for the index.  hh means use
          half of the screen for the index, and is the default.

     --xxPPaatttteerrnn
          PPaatttteerrnn is contiguous to the --xx option and signifies
          the file suffixes to be eXcluded from the display.
          Separate the suffixes by the || character.  For example,
          ded "-x.o|.mo" will exclude all .o and .mo files from
          ded's display.  It is wise to surround this option by
          quotes to prevent the shell from interpreting it.

     From left the index fields are: file mode, link count,
     owner, size, write date and name.  Executable files are
     tagged with a '*', directories with a '/', symbolic links to
     non-directories with a '@', and symlinks to directories with
     a '>'.  The bottom half of the screen is used for displaying
     files via the 't'ype command and for short command execu-
     tion.  If there are too many files to all fit on one window,
     more windows are allocated. The 'f' and 'b' commands can be
     used for stepping forward and backward windows.

     q    exits the program, displaying files marked for deletion
          and requiring confirmation before deleting them.  If no
          confirmation is given (typing anything other than y),
          ded goes back to its display.  When many files are to
          be deleted, ded does the deletions asyncronously unless
          it is top-level and can be ^Z'ed and backgrounded by
          the user.

     x    aborts completely out of ded. No deletions are done.

     ^Z   stops ded.

     h    displays a help file.

     !
     %    prompts for a system command to invoke.  Unless escaped
          via '\', all %% characters in the command itself are
          replaced with the relative pathname of the current
          entry, all ## chars are replaced with just the trailing
          filename component (what you see on the screen), and
          all @@ characters are replaced with the relative name of
          the directory whose index is currently being displayed.
          "Relative" means relative to your current working
          directory, which does not change as you descend a
          hierarchy.  When invoked via '!' the command is exe-
          cuted in the other window, if it exists, and can result
          in garbaging of the display if it has much output.
          This is designed for "action" commands, e.g. "mv".
          When invoked via '%' the screen is cleared before exe-
          cution and re-displayed afterwards.

     .    Repeats the previous !! or %% shell command, substituting
          from the current entry for any special chars (%#@) in
          the original command.

     l    re-stats the current entry and redisplays that line.
          If the file has disappeared, a '-' sign appears next to
          the file name.

     L    all the entries on the current screen are re-stat'ed
          and redisplayed.

     ^L   refreshes the screen.

     r
     s    sorts the file list by various fields: filename,
          filename treated as a number, read date, size, write
          date.  Only the first letter (e.g. f, n, r, s, or w) is
          required after giving the r and s commands. s sorts in
          increasing alphabetic, decreasing size, newest to old-
          est dates. r reverses the sense of s. For the f, n, s,
          and w orders, the date field is the write date. For the
          r subcommand, the date field is the read date. Whenever
          a sort is done, you are positioned at the top of the
          list afterwards.  A proposed sort can be aborted via
          ^G.

          target.

     u    undeletes the current entry, if it was previously
          marked for deletion.

     t
     T    types the file out to the terminal.  Little 't' speci-
          fies that in two-window mode, the bottom window be
          used, pausing after each screenful, and wrapping long
          lines.  The type-out may be interrupted by the "Inter-
          rupt" character (^C), or by 'q' when the file is
          displayed in the bottom window.  Capital 'T' says to
          use the full screen; essentially just a "cat" of the
          file.

     m    runs the local pager upon the current file.  As distri-
          buted, the default is Berkeley's mmoorree program.

     e    runs the editor defined in your EDITOR environment
          variable upon the current file.  If EDITOR is not
          defined, "vi" ("little emacs" at Utah) is used.  How-
          ever, if the current file is a directory or a symlink
          to a directory it is not edited, but rather, a recur-
          sive ded is done upon that directory.  In this manner,
          you can examine the contents of that directory and thus
          move down the directory hierarchy.

     p
     P    prints the current file on the line-printer.  At Utah,
          'p' prints in small font (pr2) while 'P' gets normal
          font size.
