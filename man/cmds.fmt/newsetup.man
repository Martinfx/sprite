     The _n_e_w_s_e_t_u_p program creates a new .newsrc file containing
     all of the currently active newsgroups.  It tries to put
     them in a reasonable order, i.e. local newsgroups earlier,
     but you'll probably want to change the ordering anyway (if
     you use _r_n) in order to put interesting newsgroups first.
     If you already have a .newsrc, it will be backed up with the
     name ".oldnewsrc".

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
