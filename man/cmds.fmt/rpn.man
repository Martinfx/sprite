     RRppnn is a stack-based desk calculator with a  screen-oriented
     front  end.   This  calculator  is  very  similar,  in  many
     respects, to  old  Hewlett-Packard  scientific  calculators.
     The  available  commands  are listed in a menu at the top of
     the screen.  the first few elements of its computation stack
     are  listed  next.   At  the  bottom of the screen is a data
     entry  area.   RRppnn  uses  ``reverse  polish  notation'',  or
     stack-oriented commands.  Thus the basic syntax is

          _a_r_g _a_r_g _o_p
          For example: 47 358 +

     This command pushes two values on the stack  (47  and  358),
     then   applies  the  operation  (+)  to  those  two  values.
     Operands are popped from  the  stack  and  replaced  by  the
     result of the operation.  Items can be pushed onto the stack
     one at a  time,  or  more  complicated  expressions  can  be
     entered all on one line:

          For example: 47 179 2 * +
          or: 47 179 * 2 +

     Note that the previous two examples are different  and  pro-
     duce different answers.

     s+         Statistical accumulation.  This accumulates  sta-
                tistical  data  on  two  variables, X and Y, into
                numbered registers.  The functions  var,  sd  and
                rms  use  this  data.  Given a series of n corre-
                lated X and Y pairs, enter each pair in the x and
                y registers, and execute s+.  The data is accumu-
                lated as follows:

                sto 10         n
                sto 9          sum XY
                sto 8          sum Y**2
                sto 7          sum Y
                sto 6          sum X**2
                sto 5          sum X

     s-         This is the inverse of s+ and is used  to  remove
                incorrectly entered X-Y pairs.

     var        The variance of X and Y is computed in  registers
                x and y, and also in registers 3 and 4.

     sd         Standard deviation of X  and  Y  is  computed  in
                registers x and y, and also in registers 3 and 4.

     rms        Root-mean squared of  X  and  Y  is  computed  in
                registers x and y, and also in registers 3 and 4.
