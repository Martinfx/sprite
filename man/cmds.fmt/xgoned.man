     The xxggoonneedd program is used  to  start  "xgone"  on  an  idle
     machine. A machine is idle if it has not received input from
     the console in a fixed amount of time.

BBUUGGSS
     An idle machine is one that has not received input from  the
     keyboard.   Mouse  motion is not considered, causing "xgone"
     to be started if the user uses only the mouse for too long.
