     JJggeett provides a  simple  file  retrieval  mechanism  for  an
     archive tape system controlled by the Jaquith program.

     The primary argument _f_i_l_e_l_i_s_t is a   file  expression  which
     specifies  the  files  to be listed.  Shell-like globbing is
     supported. '*' matches any number of characters. '?' matches
     a  single  character. Additionally, curly braces can be used
     to enclose alternatives.  For  example  foo.{bak,?}  matches
     both foo.bak, foo.c and foo.h.

     Note that any metacharacters which are not protected with  a
     backslash  or  quotes  will be expanded by the shell, not by
     the Jaquith system.

     The default action is to retrieve the most  recent  versions
     of  matching  filenames.   The set of files retrieved can be
     controlled by the use of one or more options.   The  options
     are  all  logically  ANDed together; only files matching all
     criteria are retrieved.

     The -range,  -first  and  -last  options  work  together  to
     specify  a subset of the archived versions.  First, the date
     range is applied, resulting in a list of candidates numbered
     logically  from 1 to _n.  Then the first and last options are
     applied to this list. First and last  can  be  positive  and
     retrieve  the  specified  filenames from restricted list, or
     they can be negative in which case they count from  the  end
     of  the list. Thus, the most recent version of a file can be

     retrieved with 'first -1 last -1' without having to know how
     many versions currently exist.

     _d_a_t_e is of the form _D_a_t_e_S_p_e_c[:_T_i_m_e_S_p_e_c]. _T_i_m_e_S_p_e_c is of  the
     form   [hh[:mm[:ss]]],   and   _D_a_t_e_S_p_e_c   is   of  the  form
     dd-month[-yyyy]. Month is the first 3 letters of the  month;
     all  others  are  numbers. The '/' character is a substitute
     for '-' and '.' may be used instead of ':'.


BBUUGGSS
     A file which matches more than one regular  expression  will
     be retrieved multiple times.

     There is currently no support for hard links.

     Only one archive can be specified at a time.

     Unlike the shell, the Jaquith globbing  characters  '*'  and
     '?' match a '.' in the first position.
