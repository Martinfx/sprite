     KKggddbb is a version of the GNU gdb debugger modified to  debug
     Sprite  kernels.   This manual page only describes the parts
     of kkggddbb that differ from ggddbb. The reader is referred to  the
     GNU  GDB  documentation  and  gdb manual page for a complete
     description of ggddbb.

     The "attach" and "detach" commands of kkggddbb differ from those
     of ggddbb.

     aattttaacchh machine
          The attach command of kkggddbb takes  as  an  argument  the
          hostname  or  internet  address  of a Sprite machine to
          debug. The command assumes that the  specified  machine
          is  in  the kernel debugging stub and will wait for the
          machine to enter the debugger.  Once the connection  to
          the  machine is established, the trap condition and any
          unprinted syslog messages are displayed.

     ddeettaacchh [cont]
          The detach command breaks the connection  between  kkggddbb
          and the currently attached machine.  If any argument is
          specified, the machine is continued before the  connec-
          tion is detached.  When used with the "attach" command,
          the "detach" command allows debugging multiple machines
          from the same kkggddbb session.

AADDDDIITTIIOONNSS TTOO GGDDBB
     KKggddbb supports several commands not found in ggddbb.   The  com-
     mands are:

     ppiidd proc-id

          The pid command sets the focus of the debugger  on  the
          process  whose process id is proc-id. Once a process is
          choosen with the pid command, all stack reference  com-
          mands  such  as  "backtrace" and "frame" will reference
          this process's stack.  For example,  the  command  "pid
          0xa1139"  followed  by  the  "backtrace"  command  will
          display a stack backtrace of the process  with  pid  of
          0xa1139.  Note  that proc-id can be any expression sup-
          ported by kkggddbb.

     rreebboooott [string]
          The  reboot  command  reboots  the   current   attached
          machine.  The optional argument string is passed to the
          kernel routine Mach_MonReboot.  Note that this  command
          is  the  same  as typing "print Mach_MonReboot(string)"
          followed by a break and a detach  command  except  that
          the reboot command will work even if no symbol table is
          loaded.

     vveerrssiioonn
          The version command prints the kernel version string of
          the  attached  machine.  This  command outputs the same
          information as the command "print SpriteVersion()"  but
          like  the  "reboot"  command  doesn't  require a symbol
          table to be loaded.

     ddeebbuugg hostname
          The debug command is  similar  to  the  attach  command
          differing  only  in the case when the specified machine
          is not already in the debugging stub. Rather than wait-
          ing  for  the  machine  to  enter the debugger like the
          attach  command,  the  debug  command  will  force  the
          machine  into  the  debugger using the kkmmssgg program. In
          order for this command to work, the kkmmssgg  program  must
          be  available  in  the  current  search  path  of kkggddbb.
          Because of its  anti-social  possiblities,  caution  is
          urged in the use of the debug command.

DDEELLEETTIIOONNSS FFRROOMM GGDDBB
     Several features of ggddbb are not available  in  kkggddbb  because
     they  don't  apply  to  kernel  debugging.  Missing features
     include the ability to start  and  kill  programs  with  the
     "run"  and "kill" commands; to change the program's environ-
     ment  and  terminal  characteristics  with  the   "set-env",
     "unset-env",  "set-args", and "tty" commands; and  to handle
     signals with "handle" and  "signal"  commands.  Additionaly,
     ggddbb's core file processing such as the ccoorree command are also
     not available in kkggddbb.
