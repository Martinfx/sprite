     This command is used to execute commands remotely using  the
     Sprite  process  migration facility.  It may be used to exe-
     cute commands on a particular machine or to select from idle
     machines;  and  it  may  execute  a command specified by the
     arguments to the mmiiggrraattee program, or an interactive shell.

     --BB   The --BB specifies that the host should  be  selected  at
          ``background''  priority,  rather  than at the priority
          used for other tasks such as compilations.

     --hh

     --HH   By default, a host is  selected  from  among  the  idle
          hosts  available  on  the  local network.  This host is
          then marked as being in use for  the  duration  of  the
          command being executed; the host will not be chosen for
          remote execution of other processes  in  the  meantime.
          If  a host is specified with the --hh or --HH options, then
          the ``in-use'' flag is bypassed; this  is  useful  when
          invoking mmiiggrraattee as a ``remote login'' facility to exe-
          cute commands directly on another host.   The  --hh  flag
          specifies  a host by name, and the --HH flag specifies it
          by spriteID (thereby bypassing the host database lookup
          to convert from name to internal numeric identifier).

     --ll   If no host is specified and no idle host is  available,
          the  command  is  not  executed unless the --ll option is
          specified,  in  which  case  the  command  is  executed
          locally.    The  ``--ll''  option  similiarly affects the
          disposition of the command if migrating  to  the  other
          host fails.

     To execute a single command remotely,  the  command  may  be
     specified by placing the command and its arguments after any
     options to mmiiggrraattee.  If no command is specified, an interac-
     tive shell is created.  If the SSHHEELLLL environment variable is
     present, that shell is invoked, otherwise  ccsshh  is  invoked.
     In any case, the exit status from the subprocess is returned
     by mmiiggrraattee.

          In some circumstances, programs  may  be  invoked  with
          aarrggvv[[00]]  different  from  the  name of the command.  In
          this case, the --EE option may be  used  to  specify  the
          name of a file to execute, and the first argument after
          the option list specifies the value of aarrggvv[[00]].    Oth-
          erwise,  aarrggvv[[00]] is set to the name of the command that
          is invoked.

     --pp   To migrate a process that is already executing,  invoke
          mmiiggrraattee  with  the  --pp option, giving the process ID of
          the process to migrate (in hex notation).  Each process
          must  be  migrated  individually,  in  separate runs of
          mmiiggrraattee.

OOTTHHEERR OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     --bb   The --bb option may be used to enter ``background mode'',
          in which mmiiggrraattee executes a command and returns immedi-
          ately, printing the process identifier of the  migrated
          child.  Thus,
                              mmiiggrraattee xxyyzzzzyy&&
          is different from
                             mmiiggrraattee --bb xxyyzzzzyy.
          The process identifier for the former case  is  printed
          by  the  shell,  and it corresponds to the mmiiggrraattee pro-
          cess; while the process identifier in the  latter  case
          corresponds  to  the  migrated  child  itself.   In the
          former case, normal ccsshh job  control  may  be  used  to
          foreground  and  background  the migrated child, but in
          the latter case, the process is not controlled by ccsshh.

     --vv   The --vv option may be used to enter ``verbose mode'', in
          which  case the host selected for migration is printed,
          or a message that no host could be selected is  printed
          if  the  command  is  executed  locally  due  to the --ll
          option.

     --DD   The --DD option  enables  ``debug  mode'',  which  causes
          various  debugging statements to be printed as the pro-
          gram executes.

BBUUGGSS
     If a process that is executing remotely is evicted when that
     machine is no longer available, the process will continue to
     execute locally.  This is nearly completely  transparent  to
     the  user  (ppss  --mm  will  no  longer  show  the  process  as
     migrated).  Even if the host were not selected as an  ``idle
     host'',  the  migrated  process  can be evicted if the other
     host goes from being available to being unavailable.

     If another host is selected at random to migrate  a  process
     that  is already running, when that process exits the remote
     host, the remote host will remain flagged as ``in use''  for
     a short period of time.  This is because the mmiiggrraattee process
     cannot conveniently wait for a process that isn't its child.
