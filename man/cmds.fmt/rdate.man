     _R_d_a_t_e sets the local date and time from the _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e given
     as argument.  You must be super-user on the local system.
     Typically _r_d_a_t_e can be inserted as part of your
     /_e_t_c/_r_c._l_o_c_a_l startup script.

     Could be modified to accept a list of hostnames and try each
     until a valid date returned.  Better yet would be to write a
     real date server that accepted broadcast requests.
