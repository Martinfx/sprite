     _Z_l_e_a_v_e waits until the specified time, then reminds you that
     you have to leave, using the _Z_e_p_h_y_r(_1) Notification Service.
     You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual
     time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.  When you
     log off, _z_l_e_a_v_e exits just before it would have sent the
     next message.

     The time of day is in the form hhmm where hh is a time in
     hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock).  All times are converted
     to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to be in the next 12 hours.

     If the time is preceded by `+', the alarm will go off in
     hours and minutes from the current time.

     If no argument is given, _z_l_e_a_v_e prompts with "When do you
     have to leave?". A reply of newline causes _z_l_e_a_v_e to exit,
     otherwise the reply is assumed to be a time.  This form is
     suitable for inclusion in a ._l_o_g_i_n or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e.

     The _c_a_n_c_e_l option cancels the currently running _z_l_e_a_v_e.  If
     another _z_l_e_a_v_e is running, it is automatically killed when a
     new time to leave is set.  The process id is stored in the
     file /tmp/zleave._u_i_d, where _u_i_d is the user's UNIX uid.

     If the -_m argument is specified, the next argument is
     appended to the standard message (a sentence describing how
     much time remains until the appointed hour) sent at
     appropriate times.  If you want to append a multiple-word
     message, you normally must quote it with double quotes (")
     (This is necessary for users of _c_s_h(1) and _s_h(1).)

     _Z_l_e_a_v_e automatically subscribes you to Zephyr class "MES-
     SAGE", instance "LEAVE".  You do not have to add anything to
     your default subscriptions file (see _z_c_t_l(1)).  The reminder
     message is displayed by the WindowGram client (usually
     _z_w_g_c(1)).

     If Zephyr is unavailable, _z_l_e_a_v_e acts essentially like
     _l_e_a_v_e(1).

     Zleave ignores SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and SIGTERM.  To get rid of
     it you should either log off or use the _c_a_n_c_e_l option.
