     dterm - ditroff output interpreter for terminals

     _D_t_e_r_m interprets its input (standard input default) as out-
     put from _d_i_t_r_o_f_f(I) and sends its output to standard out.
     _D_t_e_r_m is intended as a vveerryy rough previewer for seeing how a
     paper will be layed out.  Input processed for any typesetter
     is mapped into a terminal's resolution to place characters
     approximately where they would appear on the final output
     device.  This is _n_o_t meant to be readable (except with the
     --aa option, see below), and some characters will be missing.
     Typical usage:


                    ditroff -t file | dterm
                                or
                    ditroff -P`dev' -t file > intermediate
                    dterm intermediate

     At the end of each page _d_t_e_r_m prompts the user and waits for
     a newline (empty line) from the keyboard before continuing
     on to the next page.  In this wait state, _d_t_e_r_m accepts a
     few commands.  Enter ?? to print the list of available com-
     mands.

     The command line options are:

     --cc   Don't wait between pages; for directing output to _m_o_r_e
          or into a file.

     --oo_l_i_s_t
          prints only the pages enumerated in _l_i_s_t.  The list
          consists of pages and page ranges (e.g., 5-17)
          separated by commas. The range _n- goes from _n to the
          end; the range -_n goes from the beginning to and
          including page _n.

     --hh_n  Set the horizontal resolution (in characters per inch)
          to _n; default is 10.0.

     --vv_n  Set the vertical resolution (in lines per inch) to _n;
          default is 6.0.

     --ll_n  Set the maximum line length (in characters) to _n;
          default is 79.

     --mm   Allow printing of margins (default action is for dterm
          to print out only enough to show what's on the page).

          -m forces printing a page from the upper-left corner.

     --aa   force text to come out in a readable form (meant to
          look something like ``ditroff -a'').  This usually
          pushes the text farther right than it was meant to go.
          It also does not prevent lines of text from a coming
          out on top of each other.

     --LL   Put a form feed (^L) at the end of each page.

     --ww   Equivalent to ``-c -L -h20 -v12 -l131'' to format for
          extra-large printouts on a line-printer.

     --ff_s  Get special character file (see below) from _s instead
          of the default /usr/lib/font/devter/specfile.

     The ``specfile'' is a file of special character translations
     that map troff special character names to strings to print
     on a terminal.  Each line in the file consists of two
     strings separated by a space.  The first string is the spe-
     cial character name in troff and the second is what to print
     on the terminal.  Special characters NOT in this file will
     not print anything.
