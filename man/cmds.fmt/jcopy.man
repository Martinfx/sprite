     JJccooppyy is volume-to-volume utility for the Jaquith system.


     Jcopy copies one Jaquith volume to another, in its entirety.
     The  assumption  is  that the source tape is growing old and
     that the data is being rolled forward to a new tape.  There-
     fore,  Jcopy  attempts  to  keep Jaquith's view of the world
     up-to-date by editing various configuration files.  The user
     is prompted about these changes at the appropriate time.


     Omitting the --ddeessttvvooll option entirely will  cause  jcopy  to
     obtain a volume from Jaquith's free volume list.


     Jcopy negotiates with jmgr to mount the volumes. This  means
     that jcopy can run while the system is publicly available.

     Jcopy does not connect to the public  port  managed  by  the
     Jaquith  process  to discourage its use as a client program.
     This is because Jcopy makes no attempt  to  obtain  the  two
     devices  atomically.   Therefore it's possible for two jcopy
     processes to deadlock, each holding 1 device and  unable  to
     get the other.
