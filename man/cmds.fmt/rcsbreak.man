     rrccssbbrreeaakk is used to break RCS locks owned  by  others.   For
     each  _f_i_l_e  specified  on the command line, the file will be
     changed to have been checked  out  by  the  person  invoking
     rrccssbbrreeaakk.     The  file  itself  is not modified, so it will
     continue to be owned by the original holder of the lock.   A
     typical  use  of  rrccssbbrreeaakk is to obtain the lock in order to
     check a file in on behalf of another user, leaving the  file
     writable:
          rrccssbbrreeaakk _f_i_l_e
          ccii --ll _f_i_l_e
     The rrccssddiiffff program may be used  to  determine  the  changes
     already  made  to  the  file, for the purpose of logging the
     change.  Alternatively, the ccoo program may be used to  check
     out the previous version of the file, discarding any changes
     made by the former holder of the lock.

     rrccssbbrreeaakk sends mail to the former  owner  of  each  lock  it
     breaks, informing the owner that the lock has been broken.

BBUUGGSS
     The mail, generated by rrccss, does not specify the reason  why
     the lock is broken.
