     --uu            Only list files checked out by the user invok-
                   ing the program.

     --ss            For rrccssiinnffoo, produce no output if no files are
                   locked.

     This program lists files checked out via RCS.  If invoked as
     rrccssiinnffoo,  it  prints  a  verbose  description  of each file,
     including the name of each file, who locked it, its RCS ver-
     sion  number,  and the date and time when it was locked.  If
     invoked as rrccsstteellll, this program prints  just  the  name  of
     each file that is checked out.  (This may be useful for con-
     structs such as ``rrccssddiiffff `rrccsstteellll`''.)  In each  case,  the
     --uu  option may be used to restrict output to files locked by
     the caller.

     If no files are locked, rrccssiinnffoo prints  a  message  to  that
     effect  unless the --ss (silent) option is specified.  rrccsstteellll
     prints nothing in either case.

     By default, the program lists files controlled by  the  sub-
     directory RRCCSS.  It may be directed to a different RCS direc-
     tory by specifying the name of the directory on the  command
     line.
