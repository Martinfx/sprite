     --oo _p_r_e_f_i_x Generate the output file names by  prepending  the
               string _p_r_e_f_i_x to each of the pids.

     GGccoorree generates a snapshot of the current execution state of
     a  Sprite  process.   For historical reasons, these snapshot
     are referred to as core dumps or core files.  Core dumps can
     be  used  by the ggddbb debugger to examine the process's state
     as if the debugger was attached to the process.

     GGccoorree takes as arguments one or more process  ids  and  gen-
     erates  core  dumps  for  each  process in the file core._p_i_d
     where _p_i_d is the specified process id.  The --oo option allows
     a  string  other  than  "core" to be used to generate output
     file names.  If the --kk option is  specified,  the  processes
     specified  will be sent a SIGKILL signal after the core dump
     is finished.

     GGccoorree reads the register state and memory image of a process
     by  using the Sprite debugger interface (PPrroocc__DDeebbuugg.) If the
     process is not already in the DEBUG state (see the  ppss  com-
     mand), ggccoorree will send the process a SIGTRAP signal to force
     it into the DEBUG state. This operation  will  fail  if  the
     user does not have permission to send signals to the process
     or the process  has  blocked,  ignored,  or  has  a  handler
     installed for the SIGTRAP signal.  The --ss option can be used
     to inform  ggccoorree  to  use  a  signal  number  other  than  5
     (SIGTRAP).   Other  signals  that may work are 4 (SIGILL), 8
     (SIGFPE) and 11 (SIGSEGV).  GGccoorree restarts  running  process
     by sending them a SIGCONT after the dump is produced.

     The signals used by ggccoorree  to  stop  running  processes  can
     interrupt system calls such as rreeaadd,, sseelleecctt, or sslleeeepp, caus-
     ing them to return an error status of EINTR.  Some  programs
     may interpret the EINTR as an error and exit.
