DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     JJllss provides a simple directory  listing  mechanism  for  an
     archive tape system controlled by the Jaquith program.

     The primary argument _f_i_l_e_l_i_s_t is a   file  expression  which
     specifies  the  files  to be listed.  Shell-like globbing is
     supported. '*' matches any number of characters. '?' matches
     a  single  character. Additionally, curly braces can be used
     to enclose alternatives.  For  example  foo.{bak,?}  matches
     foo.bak, foo.c and foo.h.

     Note that any metacharacters which are not protected with  a
     backslash  or  quotes  will be expanded by the shell, not by
     the Jaquith system.

     The default action is to list the simple  filenames  of  the
     most  recent  versions  of  matching  filenames.  The set of
     files listed can be controlled by the use  of  one  or  more
     options.  The options are all logically ANDed together; only
     files matching all criteria are listed.

     The -range,  -first  and  -last  options  work  together  to
     specify  a subset of the archived versions.  First, the date
     range is applied, resulting in a list of candidates numbered
     logically  from 1 to _n.  Then the first and last options are
     applied to this list. First and last  can  be  positive  and
     retrieve  the  specified  filenames from restricted list, or
     they can be negative in which case they count from  the  end

     of  the list. Thus, the most recent version of a file can be
     retrieved with 'first -1 last -1' without having to know how
     many versions currently exist.

     _d_a_t_e is of the form _D_a_t_e_S_p_e_c[:_T_i_m_e_S_p_e_c]. _T_i_m_e_S_p_e_c is of  the
     form   [hh[:mm[:ss]]],   and   _D_a_t_e_S_p_e_c   is   of  the  form
     dd-month[-yyyy]. Month is the first 3 letters of the  month;
     all  others  are  numbers. The '/' character is a substitute
     for '-' and '.' may be used instead of ':'.

     By default jls simply lists the matching  filenames,  1  per
     line.  In long form jls generates:

          _m_o_d_e _o_w_n_e_r_I_D _s_i_z_e _d_a_t_e _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

     With the --ii option the "inode" information is included:

          _t_B_u_f_I_d _v_o_l_I_d _f_i_l_e_m_a_r_k _m_o_d_e _o_w_n_e_r_I_D _s_i_z_e _d_a_t_e _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

     _d_a_t_e is the archive date if the -_u  option  is  given,  else
     it's the file's last modification date.

BBUUGGSS
     The option flags have little relation  to  the  standard  ls
     options.

     No multicolumn formatting is provided.

     A file which matches more than one regular  expression  will
     be listed multiple times.

     Only one archive can be specified at a time.

     Unlike the shell, the Jaquith globbing  characters  '*'  and
     '?' match a '.' in the first position.
