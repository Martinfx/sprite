     _X_g_o_n_e locks the screen until a keypress is entered.  While
     waiting, it displays a message telling where the person went
     and when they started the program and moves this text around
     the screen to avoid burning them in at a particular loca-
     tion.

     If no _a_r_g_s _a_r_e _p_r_o_v_i_d_e_d, _t_h_e _p_r_o_g_r_a_m _d_i_s_p_l_a_y_s time.  If _a_r_g_s
     are provided, then the concatenation of the arguments,
     separated by spaces, is displayed instead of the default
     string.

     To leave _x_g_o_n_e, press any mouse key.  If password checking
     is enabled, it will prompt you for your password, which will
     not be echoed on the display.  End the password with
     ``Return.''  As an accelerator, you may simply type your
     password.  Password checking is disabled by default, so any
     input will then cause _x_g_o_n_e to exit.

     -font     Specify the font to use for text on the screen.
     -sleep    Specify the interval between moves of the block of
               text on the screen.
     -delay    Make the program drop in the background and delay
               starting for a few seconds.  This is helpful when
               invoking _x_g_o_n_e from a menu inside window managers
               like _t_w_m which don't allow a "grab" of mouse for a
               short time right at startup.
     -passwd    Enable password  checking.
