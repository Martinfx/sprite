     This program will open _d_e_v_i_c_e, which must have  the  charac-
     teristics  of  a  terminal  line, in raw mode.  It will then
     open a TCP network connection and pass bits back  and  forth
     between  the  network connection and the raw terminal.  Any-
     thing received from the network connection will  be  written
     to the terminal, and anything read from the terminal will be
     written to the network connection.  RRttttyy buffers  characters
     internally  to  prevent  any loss of information if one side
     gets ahead of the other.

     If _p_o_r_t_N_u_m is specified, is the decimal number of a  request
     socket  to  use  for  network connections.  If _p_o_r_t_N_u_m isn't
     given, then rrttttyy will attempt to find an  available  socket.
     In  either  case,  it  prints  out the decimal number of the
     socket is actually using.

     RRttttyy is designed to be used in conjunction with the Tty pro-
     gram: the port number printed by rrttttyy should be given to Tty
     to ensure that it connects to the right  place.   RRttttyy  only
     supports  a  single remote connection at a time.  If several
     connections are attempted simultaneously, all but the  first
     will be rejected.
