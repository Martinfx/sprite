     --aa _a_d_d_r_e_s_s     The --aa flag is required, and is used  to  set
                    the  local network address of the host.  Usu-
                    ally _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is an Ethernet address,  and  is
                    of the form "a:b:c:d:e:f".


     --dd _d_o_m_a_i_n      Used to set  the  local  domain.  The  _d_o_m_a_i_n
                    string  is  appended  to the name provided by
                    the --nn flag to produce the full name  of  the
                    machine.   The default is to parse the domain
                    name from the _s_p_r_i_t_e_h_o_s_t_s file.  If the  file
                    is empty then the --dd flag must be given.


     --hh, --hheellpp, --??  These options cause  a  help  listing  to  be
                    printed.


     --ii _i_n_t_e_r_n_e_t    _I_n_t_e_r_n_e_t is the internet address of the host.
                    The  address  is in the form "a.b.c.d".  This
                    flag is required.


     --II _s_p_r_i_t_e_I_D    The --II flag is used to assign a Sprite ID  to
                    the  host.   Care must be taken that _s_p_r_i_t_e_I_D
                    does not conflict with the id of an  existing
                    host.  If the --II flag is omitted aaddddhhoosstt will
                    use a Sprite ID that is one greater than  the
                    largest id found in the _s_p_r_i_t_e_h_o_s_t_s file.


     --mm _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_T_y_p_e This flag sets the machine type of  the  host
                    to  be  added.  This flag must be used.  Sup-
                    ported machine types are _s_u_n_3,  _s_u_n_4,  _s_u_n_4_c,
                    and _d_s_3_1_0_0.


     --nn _n_a_m_e        _N_a_m_e is the name of the host.  This  flag  is
                    required.


     --ss _s_w_a_p_D_i_r     The --ss defines _s_w_a_p_D_i_r to be the directory in

ADDHOST                   User Commands                   ADDHOST



                    which  to  create  the swap directory for the
                    new host.  The default is /swap.  If  a  dif-
                    ferent  directory  is  specified  then a link
                    will be make in /swap.


     --tt _n_e_t_T_y_p_e     The --tt flag is used to set the  type  of  the
                    network   associated   with  the  host.   The
                    default is _e_t_h_e_r, indicating that the host is
                    connected  to the system via an Ethernet, and
                    the the argument to the --aa flag is the Ether-
                    net address of the host.  The only other sup-
                    ported value  for  the  _n_e_t_T_y_p_e  argument  is
                    _i_n_e_t,   indicating   that  a  gateway  exists
                    between the host and the  root  file  server.
                    In  this  case the argument to the --aa flag is
                    the Ethernet address of the gateway machine.


     --RR             AAddddhhoosstt will not allow a host to be added  if
                    the  name  of the new host conflicts with the
                    name of an existing host.  If the --RR flag  is
                    specified  than the existing host information
                    is replaced with the information for the  new
                    host.   If  you  are upgrading a machine from
                    one machine type to another but retaining the
                    name then the --RR flag should be used.


     --rr _r_o_o_t        The --rr flag is used to specify that the  root
                    of  the  Sprite filesystem is something other
                    than "/".

     --oo _o_w_n_e_r       Used to specify the owner or primary user  of
                    the  machine.   This  information is added to
                    /sprite/admin/hosts.


     --ll _l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n    Used to specify the location of the  machine.
                    This      information     is     added     to
                    /sprite/admin/hosts.


     --TT _m_a_c_h_i_n_e _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n
                    The --TT flag  is  used  to  specify  the  full
                    machine   description.    Examples  might  be
                    "sun3/75" or "sun4/260".  This information is
                    added to /sprite/admin/hosts.

ADDHOST                   User Commands                   ADDHOST



DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The aaddddhhoosstt command is used to add a new host to the system.
     It  should  only  be run by the super-user (root).  Invoking
     aaddddhhoosstt without any options will  cause  it  to  run  in  an
     interactive  mode  where  you  will be prompted for the host
     name, type, etc.  These  parameters  can  also  be  set  via
     options  on the command line.  The use of any options causes
     aaddddhhoosstt to not run interactively.  In this  case  a  minimum
     set  of  options  must  be used.  The --aa, --ii, --nn, --mm, and --ss
     flags must be used to indicate the local  address,  Internet
     address,  host  name, host machine type, and swap directory,
     respectively.  The options are described in more  detail  in
     the section above.

     As the aaddddhhoosstt script runs it will print out information  on
     the  actions  it is taking.  Once the script is complete you
     should  look  in  /sprite/admin/howto/addNewHost   for   any
     remaining steps in the installation procedure.
