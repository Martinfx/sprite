     The JJaaqquuiitthh system is a tertiary storage manager which  pro-
     vides  storage,  indexing  and retrieval services to network
     clients.


     This man page describes JJaaqquuiitthh, the main server. The  other
     parts of the system include:


          jmgr   -- the jukebox manager
          jclean -- the archive cleaner
          jput, jget, jls, jstat -- Client utilities
          jupdate, jfetch, jquery -- Jaquith servant processes
          jcopy, jctrl, jbuild -- System administration utilities

     The jaquith process is the primary server  for  the  Jaquith
     archive  system.   It  listens on a public port for incoming
     client requests and spawns child processes to  handle  those
     requests.  The port is specified with the --ppoorrtt option. Each
     jjppuutt request spawns a _w_r_i_t_e_r as specified with the  --ppuutteexxeecc
     option. Similarly, each jjggeett or jls request spawns a _r_e_a_d_e_r.
     jjssttaatt requests spawn _q_u_e_r_y processes.


     Jaquith also spawns a _c_l_e_a_n_e_r process which writes data from
     disk  to  tertiary  storage,  as  necessary.  The cleaner is
     specified with the  --cclleeaanneexxeecc  option,  and  the  threshold
     which controls its invocation is specified with the -disklow
     and --ddiisskkhhiigghh options. DDiisskkHHiigghh gives the level of disk use,
     in  percent, when the cleaner should be invoked. The cleaner
     will clean the disk down to the low water mark, --ddiisskkllooww.


     Jaquith assumes the presence of the jukebox manager, a  pro-
     cess which mediates access to the physical jukebox. See jmgr
     for details.

JAQUITH                   User Commands                   JAQUITH



     To install Jaquith initially, create a directory to  act  as
     the  Jaquith  root,  typically  /jaquith.  It's  easiest  if
     DEF_ROOT (in jaquith.h) is set to this name and all the pro-
     grams  are  recompiled.  Then create volconfig and devconfig
     files for jmgr. Start jaquith and jmgr and you're set.


     To grant access to Jaquith to a new user, create a new logi-
     cal  archive,  if desired, by creating a subdirectory in the
     Jaquith root called _a_r_c_h_N_a_m_e..aarrcchh.   In  this  subdirectory,
     create the aauutthh file, as described in the RELATED FILES sec-
     tion, or just add the user  to  the  existing  authorization
     file.


RREELLAATTEEDD FFIILLEESS
     Jaquith maintains a number of files describing the state  of
     the  physical and logical archive. All of these files reside
     in the Jaquith root (usually /arch  but  settable  with  the
     -root flag).

     ffrreeeevvoollss      The global pool of available  volumes.   These
                   will be consumed as needed by the cleaner pro-
                   cess. Format of an entry is  just  the  volume
                   ID.

     ddeevvccoonnffiigg     The list of device names to be  controlled  by
                   the  jukebox  manager.   Format is device name
                   followed by its slot in the jukebox.

     vvoollccoonnffiigg     The list of volumes and their  slot  locations
                   in the jukebox. Format is the volume name fol-
                   lowed by its slot in the jukebox.

     ttbbuuff..llrruu      The global  least-recently-used  buffer  list.
                   Buffers  at the top of the list are prime can-
                   didates for removal if disk  space  is  tight.
                   Format  is  logical  archive  name followed by
                   tbuf number.

     rreebbuuiilldd.._p_i_d   Temporary work file created by jjbbuuiilldd.

     tthhddrr.._p_i_d._n_u_m  Emergency work file created by jjbbuuiilldd when  it
                   can't parse the thdr file it got from tape.

     _a_r_c_h_i_v_e//ccoonnffiigg
                   Archive configuration information.  Format  is
                   jmgr  server  name and port number followed by
                   desired buffer size.

     _a_r_c_h_i_v_e//ttbbuuff  Current buffer number. I.E. current buffer  is
                   ttbbuuff.._n_u_m.

                   Tape header files.  These  files  contain  the
                   indexing  information  in  case the disk index
                   structure is destroyed.

     _a_r_c_h_i_v_e//mmeettaa.._n_u_m

     _a_r_c_h_i_v_e//lloogg   The  list  of  operations  which   have   been
                   requested on this logical archive.

     _a_r_c_h_i_v_e//ffiilleemmaapp
                   The list of volumes assigned to  this  archive
                   along  with  the starting buffer number on the

     _a_r_c_h_i_v_e//aauutthh  The authorization information for the  logical
                   archive.  The  file  consists  of  single-line
                   entries in no particular order. Each entry has
                   the  form  _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e _g_r_o_u_p_n_a_m_e _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e _p_e_r_m_i_s_-
                   _s_i_o_n.  _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e, _g_r_o_u_p_n_a_m_e, and  _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e  are
                   globbing  expressions.  _P_e_r_m_i_s_s_i_o_n is RR, WW, or
                   OO  for  read,  read-and-write   or   ownership
                   respectively.  Ownership means that the speci-
                   fied user or group has 'root' access  to  this
                   logical archive. Client requests are validated
                   by  first  looking  for  an   entry   with   a
                   corresponding user name. If none is found then
                   an entry with a matching group name  is  used,
                   else permission is denied.

     _a_r_c_h_i_v_e//vvoolliinnffoo
                   Physical volume information for  this  logical
                   archive.  Entries are: current volume id, next
                   location on volume where buffer is to be writ-
                   ten,  remaining  space  in  KB on volume, last
                   buffer number written, current buffer number.

     _a_r_c_h_i_v_e//ttbbuuffiinnffoo
                   Current buffer information  for  this  logical
                   archive.  Entries  are:  buffer size in bytes,
                   buffer header size in bytes,  number  of  user
                   files in buffer.

BBUUGGSS
     None. Jaquith is perfection personified.
