     The _x_a_r_g_s utility reads space, tab, newline and end-of-file
     delimited arguments from the standard input and executes the
     specified _u_t_i_l_i_t_y with them as arguments.

     The utility and any arguments specified on the command line
     are given to the _u_t_i_l_i_t_y upon each invocation, followed by
     some number of the arguments read from standard input.  The
     _u_t_i_l_i_t_y is repeatedly executed until standard input is
     exhausted.

     Spaces, tabs and newlines may be embedded in arguments using
     single (`` ' '') or double (``"'') quotes or backslashes
     (``\'').  Single quotes escape all non-single quote charac-
     ters, excluding newlines, up to the matching single quote.
     Double quotes escape all non-double quote characters,
     excluding newlines, up to the matching double quote.  Any
     single character, including newlines, may be escaped by a
     backslash.

     The options are as follows:

     -n number
          Set the maximum number of arguments taken from standard
          input for each invocation of the utility.  An invoca-
          tion of _u_t_i_l_i_t_y will use less than _n_u_m_b_e_r standard
          input arguments if the number of bytes accumulated (see
          the -_s option) exceeds the specified _s_i_z_e or there are
          fewer than _n_u_m_b_e_r arguments remaining for the last
          invocation of _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.  The current default value for
          _n_u_m_b_e_r is 5000.

     -s size
          Set the maximum number of bytes for the command line
          length provided to _u_t_i_l_i_t_y.  The sum of the length of
          the utility name and the arguments passed to _u_t_i_l_i_t_y
          (including NULL terminators) will be less than or equal
          to this number.  The current default value for _s_i_z_e is
          ARG_MAX - 2048.

     -t   Echo the command to be executed to standard error
          immediately before it is executed.

     -x   Force _x_a_r_g_s to terminate immediately if a command line
          containing _n_u_m_b_e_r arguments will not fit in the speci-
          fied (or default) command line length.

     If no _u_t_i_l_i_t_y is specified, _e_c_h_o(1) is used.

     Undefined behavior may occur if _u_t_i_l_i_t_y reads from the stan-
     dard input.

     The _x_a_r_g_s utility exits immediately (without processing any
     further input) if a command line cannot be assembled, _u_t_i_l_-
     _i_t_y cannot be invoked, an invocation of the utility is ter-
     minated by a signal or an invocation of the utility exits
     with a value of 255.

     The _x_a_r_g_s utility exits with a value of 0 if no error
     occurs.  If _u_t_i_l_i_t_y cannot be invoked, _x_a_r_g_s exits with a
     value of 127.  If any other error occurs, _x_a_r_g_s exits with a
     value of 1.

     The _x_a_r_g_s utility is expected to be POSIX 1003.2 compliant.
