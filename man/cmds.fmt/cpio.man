     ccppiioo copies files in to and out from a ccppiioo copy archive.
     The archive (built by `ccppiioo --oo') contains pathname and
     status information, along with the contents of one or more
     archived files.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     --oo   Copy out an archive.  Read the standard input for a
          list of pathnames, then copy the named files to the
          standard output in archive form - including pathname
          and status information.

          aa    Reset the access times of input files after they
               have been copied.

          BB    Output is to be blocked at 5120 bytes to the
               record.  This does not apply to the _p_a_s_s option.
               This option is only meaningful with data directed
               to raw magnetic devices, such as `//ddeevv//rrmmtt?'.

          cc    Write _h_e_a_d_e_r information in ASCII character form
               for portability.

          vv    Verbose. A list of filenames is displayed.  When
               used with the tt option, the table of contents
               looks like the output of an `llss --ll' command (see
               llss(1V)).

     --ii   Copy in an archive.  Read in an archive from the stan-
          dard input and extract files with names matching
          filename substitution _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s, supplied as arguments.

          _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s are similar to those in sshh(1) or ccsshh(1), save
          that within ccppiioo, the metacharacters `??', `**' and `[[
          ... ]]' also match the `//' (slash) character.  If no
          _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s are specified, the default is ** (select all
          files).

          bb    Swap both bytes and half-words after reading in
               data.

          BB    Input is to be blocked at 5120 bytes to the
               record.  This does not apply to the _p_a_s_s option.
               This option is only meaningful with data received

               from raw magnetic devices, such as `//ddeevv//rrmmtt?'.

          dd    Create directories as needed.

          ff    Copy in all files except those matching _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s.

          mm    Retain previous file modification time.  This
               option is ineffective on directories that are
               being copied.

          rr    Interactively rename files.  If the user types a
               null line, the file is skipped.  May not be used
               with the --pp option.

          ss    Swap bytes after reading in data.

          SS    Swap halfwords after reading in data.

          tt    Print a table of contents of the input archive.
               No files are created.

          uu    Copy unconditionally.  Normally, an older file
               will not replace a newer file with the same name.

          66    Process UNIX Version-6 files.

     --pp   One pass.  Copy in and out in a single operation.  Des-
          tination pathnames are interpreted relative to the
          named _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

          ll    Whenever possible, link files rather than copying
               them.

     To copy the contents of a directory into an archive:

          eexxaammppllee%% llss || ccppiioo --oo >> //ddeevv//mmtt00

     directory:

     ccppiioo archive tapes from other sites may have bytes swapped
     within the archive.  Although the --iiss option only swaps the
     data bytes and not those in the header ccppiioo recognizes tapes
     like this and swaps the bytes in the header automatically.

BBUUGGSS
     ccppiioo does not support multiple volume tapes.

     Pathnames are restricted to 128 characters.  If there are
     too many unique linked files, ccppiioo runs out of memory and
     linking information is lost thereafter.  Only the super-user
     can copy special files.
