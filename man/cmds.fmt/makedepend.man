     --DD _d_e_f              Define a macro.  This argument  has  the
                         same  meaning as the corresponding argu-
                         ment to cccc.

     --ff _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e         Use _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e as the makefile to  modify.
                         If  _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e  is  ``-'', mmaakkeeddeeppeenndd will
                         simply print dependency  information  on
                         standard  output.   _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e defaults to
                         mmaakkeeffiillee   if   it   exists,   otherwise
                         MMaakkeeffiillee.

     --II _i_n_c_l_u_d_e_D_i_r       Search for include files  in  _i_n_c_l_u_d_e_D_i_r
                         before  looking  in  the  default system
                         directories.  If there are many --II argu-
                         ments,  the  directories are searched in
                         the same order as the arguments.

     --mm _t_m               Use _t_m as the target  machine  for  gen-
                         erating    dependencies.    The   target
                         machine  determines   where   mmaakkeeddeeppeenndd
                         looks for machine-dependent header files
                         (see below).   If  this  option  is  not
                         specified,  the  target machine defaults
                         to the value of the $$MMAACCHHIINNEE environment
                         variable.

     --oo _s_u_f_f_i_x           Use  _s_u_f_f_i_x  as  the  suffix   for   the
                         ``object''  files  listed in the output.
                         If this argument is not  specified,  the
                         suffix defaults to ..oo.

     --pp                  Output  the  full  path  name  for  each
                         include  file.   If  this  switch  isn't
                         specified, then only  the  include  file
                         name  given in the ##iinncclluuddee statement is
                         output.

     --ss _s_t_r_i_n_g           If this switch is given,  _s_t_r_i_n_g  speci-
                         fies  the comment string that identifies
                         the beginning  of  dependencies  in  the
                         makefile.   _S_t_r_i_n_g  must  start with the
                         comment character ``#''.

                         dependencies  then  they will be grouped
                         onto a single line in  the  output  file
                         unless  this  grouping  would  cause the

     MMaakkeeddeeppeenndd is a program that generates dependency lines  for
     makefiles.  It reads a collection of C source files given by
     the _f_i_l_e arguments and generates a collection of lines  each
     having the form

          ffiillee..oo::   xx..hh   yy..hh   //aa//bb//cc..hh

     These dependency lines describe all  of  the  include  files
     used directly or indirectly in compiling each source _f_i_l_e.

     MMaakkeeddeeppeenndd normally inserts the dependency  lines  into  the
     file  mmaakkeeffiillee  if it exists, or MMaakkeeffiillee otherwise (see the
     --ff option for other alternatives).  To insert the  dependen-
     cies  in  a makefile, mmaakkeeddeeppeenndd searches the makefile for a
     trigger line.  Usually the trigger line is

          ## DDOO NNOOTT DDEELLEETTEE TTHHIISS LLIINNEE ---- mmaakkee ddeeppeenndd ddeeppeennddss oonn iitt..

     but a different trigger string may be selected with  the  --ss
     switch.  MMaakkeeddeeppeenndd locates the trigger line, deletes all of
     the information after the trigger line, and replaces it with
     the  dependency  lines.   A  backup  copy  of  the  original
     makefile is saved in _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e..bbaakk~~, where  _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e  is  the
     name of the original makefile.

     MMaakkeeddeeppeenndd duplicates the actions of cccc in determining which
     include  files  are  required  for  each  _f_i_l_e.  It normally
     checks for include files in the current directory,  then  in
     //sspprriittee//lliibb//iinncclluuddee,   then   in   //sspprriittee//lliibb//iinncclluuddee//_t_m..mmdd
     (where _t_m is the target machine being compiled for;  this is
     either the value of the $$MMAACCHHIINNEE environment variable or the
     value given in the --mm option).  If  --II  options  are  given,
     then those directories are searched before the standard sys-
     tem directories.  MMaakkeeddeeppeenndd processes conditional  compila-
     tion  statements  such  as  ##ddeeffiinnee  and ##iiffddeeff in a fashion

     similar to the C preprocessor in order to consider only  the
     include  files  that  would  be processed by the C compiler.
     You should pass the same --DD options to mmaakkeeddeeppeenndd  that  you
     would  give  to  cccc.   MMaakkeeddeeppeenndd can also deal with ##iiff and  |
     ##eelliiff directive, except that the only allowable  expressions  |
     are  ddeeffiinneedd((_f_o_o))  and  !!ddeeffiinneedd((_f_o_o)).  Any other expression  |
     will evaluate to false.

     There are several options that control the formatting of the
     dependency  lines.  Normally, the first field of each output
     line is _x..oo, where _x is one of the _f_i_l_e arguments  with  the
     ..cc or any other suffix stripped off.  However, the --oo option
     may be used to place a suffix other than ..oo  in  the  output
     lines.   The  --pp  option controls how completely the include
     file names are specified in the output.   If  --pp  is  given,
     then  the  complete path name of each header file is output.
     If --pp is not given, then  only  the  name  from  the  actual
     ##iinncclluuddee  statement  is  output (e.g., ssyyss//ffiillee..hh instead of
     //sspprriittee//lliibb//iinncclluuddee//ssyyss//ffiillee..hh).  This default is useful for
     Pmake,  which  manages  its  own  include  file search path.
     Finally, the --ww switch may be used to control the length  of
     the output lines, and the --vv switch causes extra information
     about nested includes to be output in the  form  of  comment
     lines.

     Can't handle arbitrary expressions following ##iiff or ##eelliiff.    |

     Makedepend's algorithm can cause problems in some cases.  It  |
     only  parses  each include file once and generates a list of  |
     dependencies for that file.  However,  if  defines  are  set  |
     differently, it could be that an include file will depend on  |
     two different sets of files in  two  different  invocations.  |
     In  this case, makedepend will return the wrong dependencies  |
     for the second case.
