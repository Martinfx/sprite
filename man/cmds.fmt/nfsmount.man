     NNffssmmoouunntt is a pseudo-filesystem server that provides  access
     to  a  remote NFS file system.  The first argument is a host
     name, a separating colon (`:'), and a file  system  on  that
     host.   The  second  argument is a Sprite prefix under which
     the remote file system will be visible.  The server is still
     very  simple,  although  quite  functional.   Each operation
     causes an RPC to the remote host;  there is no caching yet.

     Real NFS allows one filesystem to be  mounted  onto  another
     NFS  filesystem.  This doesn't work in Sprite because Sprite
     requires a  remote  link  (see  ln  command)  for  each  NFS
     filesystem  and  it  is  not possible to create one of these
     within the parent NFS filesystem. Consequently, the subsidi-
     ary filesystem must be mounted elsewhere in the Sprite tree.
     Then the parent nfsmount program must be told that there  is
     a  logical  mount  point  within  its namespace using the -m
     option.  The first argument is the  name  (relative  to  the
     root  of  the  parent  tree) where the mount point logically
     exists. The second parameter is the  absolute  path  of  the
     remote  link  where  the child NFS tree is really mounted in
     Sprite.

     The ggeettppwwdd(()) library call doesn't work yet because it  can't
     find  the ``inode'' number of the prefix correctly.  This is
     fixable but may not happen right away.  A related problem is
     that the ddff command won't report disk space.
