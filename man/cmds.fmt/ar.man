     aa              Position the named files after _p_o_s_n_a_m_e.

     bb              Position the named files before _p_o_s_n_a_m_e.

     cc              If creating an archive for the first time, do
                    it silently.

     dd              Command: delete  the  named  files  from  the
                    archive.

     ii              Position the named files before _p_o_s_n_a_m_e.

     ll              Ignored.  This flag is kept for compatibility
                    with the UNIX aarr.

     mm              Command: move the named files to a  different
                    location in the archive.

     oo              When extracting a file from the archive, give
                    it the last-modified time that is recorded in
                    the archive.  The default is to give  it  the
                    current time.

     pp              Command: print out the named  files.   If  no
                    files  are  named, print out all files in the
                    archive.

     qq              Command: quickly append the  named  files  to
                    the  archive.   If  the  named  files already
                    exist, the archive will end  up  with  dupli-
                    cates.  This command is intended for creating
                    a new archive with lots  of  files  with  one
                    invocation of aarr.

     rr              Command:  replace  the  named  files  in  the
                    archive.   If  a  named file isn't already in
                    the archive, it is added.

     ss              Create a  ____..SSYYMMDDEEFF  file  for  the  archive.
                    This  flag  may  be used as a command or as a
                    modifier to other commands.

     tt              Command: list the named files in the archive.

                    If  no files are named, the table of contents
                    for the entire archive is listed.

     uu              If replacing files, only replace a file if it
                    is  newer than the version in the archive (or
                    if there is no  version  in  the  archive  at
                    all).

     vv              Turn on the ``verbose'' flag.

     xx              Command: extract the  named  files  from  the
                    archive.   If no files are named, extract all
                    files in the archive.

     AArr maintains archive files, which are collections  of  other
     files.   An  archive  file  is  usually used as a library of
     object files, for use with lldd.

     Each invocation of aarr always takes one command flag  and  an
     archive name.  It may also take modifier flags, which appear
     with the command letter.   For  example,  ttvv  specifies  the
     ``table-of-contents''  command,  with  the  ``verbose'' flag
     turned on.  It is equivalent to vvtt.  If you specify  any  of
     the  aa,  bb,  or  ii flags (for the mm or rr commands), you must
     also specify _p_o_s_n_a_m_e, which is the name of  a  file  in  the
     archive  that  other  files  will be positioned relative to.
     The default is to place the files at the end of the archive.
     Finally,  most commands require that you specify one or more
     file names.  These names refer  to  files  in  the  archive,
     files  outside  the  archive, or both, depending on the com-
     mand.

     You may specify a complete path for any file name.  AArr  will
     remove  leading  path information and truncate the file name
     to 15 characters to get the name of the file as it is stored
     in  the  archive.  However, the full given path will be used
     when referring to files outside the archive for  the  qq,  rr,
     and xx commands.

     Some UNIX linkers require that an object file library have a
     ____..SSYYMMDDEEFF  file,  which  contains  a  string  table that the
     linker lldd uses to resolve external references.  This version
     of  aarr  maintains  the ____..SSYYMMDDEEFF file automatically, once it
     exists, and it will create the ____..SSYYMMDDEEFF file if the ss  flag
     is  specified.   Thus,  rraannlliibb, which is the program usually
     used to maintain the ____..SSYYMMDDEEFF file, is not needed with this
     version of aarr.

     The vv flag has a varied effect,  depending  on  the  command
     involved.   For  most commands, specifying the vv flag merely

     causes aarr to tell you what it's doing as it  does  it.   For
     the tt command, the vv flag causes information about each file
     (other than just its name) to be printed.   This  additional
     information consists of

     o+    the permissions associated with the file (as displayed by
          llss)

     o+    the file's owner and group (displayed as integers)

     o+    the file's length in bytes

     o+    the last-modified time of the file
