     _D_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t selects pages from a DVI file produced by TeX,
     creating a new DVI file usable by any of TeX's conversion
     program (e.g., iptex), or even by dviselect itself.

     A _r_a_n_g_e is a string of the form _f_i_r_s_t:_l_a_s_t where both _f_i_r_s_t
     and _l_a_s_t are optional numeric strings, with negative numbers
     indicated by a leading underscore character ``_''.  If both
     _f_i_r_s_t and _l_a_s_t are omitted, the colon may also be omitted,
     or may be replaced with an asterisk ``*''.  A _p_a_g_e _r_a_n_g_e is
     a list of ranges separated by periods.  A _l_i_s_t _o_f _p_a_g_e_s is
     described by a set of page ranges separated by commas and/or
     white space.

     _D_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t actually looks at the ten _c_o_u_n_t variables that TeX
     writes; the first of these (\count0) is the page number,
     with \count1 through \count9 having varied uses depending on
     which macro packages are in use.  (Typically \count1 is a
     chapter or section number.)  A page is included in
     _d_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t's output if all its \count values are within any
     one of the ranges listed on the command line.  For example,
     the command ``dviselect *.1,35:'' might select everything in
     chapter 1, as well as pages 35 and up.  ``dviselect 10:30''
     would select pages 10 through 30 (inclusive).  ``:43'' means
     everything up to and including page 43 (including negative-
     numbered pages).  If a Table of Contents has negative page
     numbers, ``:_1'' will select it.  ``*.4 .........1'' might
     mean everything in every chapter 4 and an index, presuming
     \count9 was set to 1 in the index.  (``*'' must be quoted
     from the shell; the null string is more convenient to use,
     if harder to read.)

     Instead of \count values, _d_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t can also select by
     ``absolute page number'', where the first page is page 1,
     the second page 2, and so forth.  Absolute page numbers are
     indicated by a leading equal sign ``=''.  Ranges of absolute
     pages are also allowed: ``dviselect =3:7'' will extract the
     third through seventh pages.  Dot separators are not legal
     in absolute ranges, and there are no negative absolute page
     numbers.

     More precisely, an asterisk or a null string implies no
     limit; an equal sign means absolute pages rather than
     \counts; a leading colon means everything up to and includ-
     ing the given page; a trailing colon means everything from

     the given page on; and a period indicates that the next
     \count should be examined.  If fewer than 10 ranges are
     specified, the remaining \counts are left unrestricted (that
     is, ``1:5'' and ``1:5.*'' are equivalent).  A single number
     _n is treated as if it were the range _n:_n.  An arbitrary
     number of page selectors may be given, separated by commas
     or whitespace; a page is selected if any of the selectors
     matches its \counts or absolute page number.

     Dviselect normally prints the page numbers of the pages
     selected; the -_s option suppresses this.

     A leading ``-'' ought to be allowed for negative numbers,
     but it is currently used as a synonym for ``:'', for back-
     wards compatibility.

     Section or subsection selection will sometimes fail, for the
     DVI file lists only the \count values that were active when
     the page ended.  Clever macro packages can alleviate this by
     making use of other ``free'' \count registers.  Chapters
     normally begin on new pages, and do not suffer from this
     particular problem.

     _D_v_i_s_e_l_e_c_t does not adjust the parameters in the postamble;
     however, since these values are normally used only to size
     certain structures in the output conversion programs, and
     the parameters never need to be adjusted upward, this has
     not proven to be a problem.
