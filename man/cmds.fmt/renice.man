     renice - alter priority of running processes

     rreenniiccee priority [ [ --pp ] pid ... ] [ [ --gg ] pgrp ... ]

     _R_e_n_i_c_e alters the scheduling priority of one or more running
     processes.  The _w_h_o parameters are interpreted as process
     ID's, process group ID's, or user names.  _R_e_n_i_c_e'ing a pro-
     cess group causes all processes in the process group to have
     their scheduling priority altered. By default, the processes
     to be affected are specified by their process ID's.  To
     force _w_h_o parameters to be interpreted as process group
     ID's, a --gg may be specified.  Supplying --pp will reset _w_h_o
     interpretation to be (the default) process ID's.

     Users other than the super-user may only alter the priority
     of processes they own, and can only monotonically increase
     their ``nice value'' within the range 0 to PRIO_MAX (20).
     (This prevents overriding administrative fiats.) The super-
     user may alter the priority of any process and set the
     priority to any value in the range PRIO_MIN (-20) to
     PRIO_MAX.  Useful priorities are: 20 (the affected processes
     will run only when nothing else in the system wants to), 0
     (the ``base'' scheduling priority), anything negative (to
     make things go very fast).

     /etc/passwd    to map user names to user ID's

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     getpriority(2), setpriority(2)

BBUUGGSS
     Non super-users can not increase scheduling priorities of
     their own processes, even if they were the ones that
     decreased the priorities in the first place.

SSPPRRIITTEE
     Renice on Sprite must map Unix priorities in the range -20
     to 20 into one of the five Sprite priorities. The mapping is
     done as follows:
     -20 - -20 -> -20
     -19 - -10 -> -10
      -9 -   9 ->  0
      10 -  19 -> 10
      20 -  20 -> 20
     For example, renice'ing a process to priority 9 will cause
     it to run at the same priority as processes reniced to -9
     through 9.
