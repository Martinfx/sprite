     --vv   Print out information about the virtual host, which  is
          the host on which the process is executing if it is not
          migrated, or the process's home node if it is migrated.
          This is the default.

     --pp   Print out information about the physical host, which is
          the  host on which the process is physically executing,
          regardless of whether it is migrated.

     --ii   Print out sprite ID instead of host name.

     --ttyyppee
          Print out the machine type.

     By default, hhoossttnnaammee prints out the  official  name  of  the
     host  on  which  the process ``appears'' to be executing, as
     specified in the host description file.  (This is equivalent
     to  the  --vv, or virtual host, option.)  Other options may be
     used to specify that information about the host on which the
     process  is  currently  physically  executing be printed, or
     that the integer sprite ID of the  host  is  to  be  printed
     instead of host name.
