     mt - magnetic tape control

     mmtt [ --ff _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e ] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [ _c_o_u_n_t ]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     mmtt sends commands to a magnetic tape drive.  If _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e is
     not specified, the environment variable is used.  If does
     not exist, mmtt uses the device //ddeevv//rrmmtt1122.  _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e refers
     to a raw tape device.  By default, mmtt performs the requested
     operation once;  multiple operations may be performed by
     specifying _c_o_u_n_t.

     The available commands are listed below.  Only as many char-
     acters as are required to uniquely identify a command need
     be specified.

     mmtt returns a 0 exit status when the operation(s) were suc-
     cessful, 1 if the command was unrecognized or if mmtt was
     unable to open the specified tape drive, and 2 if an opera-
     tion failed.

     eeooff, wweeooff    Write _c_o_u_n_t EOF marks at the current position
                  on the tape.

     ffssff          Forward space over _c_o_u_n_t EOF marks. The tape is
                  positioned on the first block of the file.

     ffssrr          Forward space _c_o_u_n_t records.

     bbssff          Back space over _c_o_u_n_t EOF marks.  The tape is
                  positioned on the beginning-of-tape side of the
                  EOF mark.

     bbssrr          Back space _c_o_u_n_t records.

     nnbbssff         Back space _c_o_u_n_t files.  The tape is positioned
                  on the first block of the file.  This is
                  equivalent to _c_o_u_n_t+_1 bbssff's followed by one
                  ffssff.

     aassff          Absolute space to _c_o_u_n_t file number.  This is
                  equivalent to a rreewwiinndd followed by a ffssff _c_o_u_n_t.

     For the following commands, _c_o_u_n_t is ignored:

     eeoomm          Space to the end of recorded media on the tape.
                  This is useful for appending files onto previ-
                  ously written tapes.
