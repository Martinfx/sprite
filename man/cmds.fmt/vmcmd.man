     This command sets various parameters of the  virtual  memory
     system.  It is implemented using the Vm_Cmd system call.  It
     controls behavior of the virtual memory system in  7  areas:
     virtual  memory  and file system negotiation, virtual memory
     tracing, the speed of the clock algorithm, flushing of  seg-
     ments,   prefetch,  copy-on-write  and  other  miscellaneous
     things.

VVMM--FFSS NNEEGGOOTTIIAATTIIOONN
     There are four options to vvmmccmmdd that can be used to  control
     the  negotiation  between  the virtual memory system and the
     file system.  The most interesting  are  the  options  which
     allow  the file  system to be penalized relative to the vir-
     tual memory system.  The --FF and --nn options are used to  con-
     trol  the  penalty.   The  simplest way to penalize the file
     system is to supply the --FF _p_e_n_a_l_t_y option  with  a  negative
     number.  In  this  case  the file system is penalized by the
     absolute value of _p_e_n_a_l_t_y each time that it asks for memory.

VMCMD                     User Commands                     VMCMD



     The  penalty  is  assessed  by adding _p_e_n_a_l_t_y seconds to the
     access time of each VM page so that the  VM  pages  seem  to
     have been used more recently than they really have.

     The --nn _n_u_m_G_r_o_u_p_s option  gives  a  more  complex  method  of
     penalizing  the file system.  With this option the number of
     available pages are divided up into _n_u_m_G_r_o_u_p_s groups.   When
     the  file  system asks for memory the penalty depends on how
     many pages that it already has.  Its penalty is assessed as

          (_c_u_r_r_e_n_t-_n_u_m_b_e_r-_o_f-_p_a_g_e_s / _n_u_m_G_r_o_u_p_s) * _p_e_n_a_l_t_y

     seconds.

     There are two other ways to effect  the  VM-FS  negotiation.
     The --aa option can be used to force the virtual memory system
     to always refuse to give memory to the file system.  The  --AA
     can  be  used  to force the virtual memory sysytem to always
     satisfy the file system's requests for  memory  as  long  as
     they are feasible.  These options are designed to be used to
     determine the effect of different polices on VM and FS nego-
     tiation.

TTRRAACCIINNGG
     The virtual memory system has the ability to  trace  segment
     creation and destruction, reference and modify bit use, page
     faults and copy-on-write behavior.   Tracing  is  turned  on
     with  --tt  _t_r_a_c_e_P_e_r_S_e_c  option.   Once  tracing  is turned on
     everything but the reference and modify bit traces  will  be
     traced as it occurs.  However, the reference and modify bits
     are traced by scanning the hardware  page  maps  _t_r_a_c_e_P_e_r_S_e_c
     times  per second.  The output of the trace is stored in the
     file ``/sprite/vmtrace/tfile._h_o_s_t-_i_d'' where _h_o_s_t-_i_d is  the
     sprite  id  for the host.  Tracing is terminated with the --TT
     option.

CCLLOOCCKK
     The virtual memory system keeps  all  pages  in  approximate
     least-recently-used  (LRU)  order  by using a version of the
     clock algorithm.  The  clock  algorithm  is  implemented  by
     scanning  a  given  number  of  pages  in  memory  every few
     seconds.  The number of pages that are scanned  can  be  set
     with  the --cc _p_a_g_e_s_T_o_C_h_e_c_k option and how often the pages are
     scanned can be set  with  the  --ss  _n_u_m_S_e_c_o_n_d_s  option.   The
     result  is  that  _p_a_g_e_s_T_o_C_h_e_c_k  pages are checked every _n_u_m_-
     _S_e_c_o_n_d_s.

FFLLUUSSHHIINNGG
     In order to allow measurement of the performance of the vir-
     tual memory system, vvmmccmmdd allows segments to be flushed from
     memory.  When a segment is flushed dirty pages  are  written
     to  swap space and the pages in the segment are removed from

     memory.  The --xx _s_e_g_N_u_m option is used to specify which  seg-
     ment  to  flush  and  the  --ll  _l_o_w_P_a_g_e_N_u_m and --hh _h_i_g_h_P_a_g_e_N_u_m
     options are used to specify the range of pages to flush.  By
     default  the  lowest page to flush is the lowest page in the
     segment and the highest is the highest page in the  segment.
     However,  the --ll or --hh options can be used to set the lowest
     page to _l_o_w_P_a_g_e_N_u_m and the highest  to  _h_i_g_h_P_a_g_e_N_u_m  respec-
     tively.

PPRREEFFEETTCCHH
     Both the virtual memory system and the file system implement
     prefetch.   Virtual  memory prefetch can be turned on or off
     by using the --PP _f_l_a_g_V_a_l_u_e option; if _f_l_a_g_V_a_l_u_e  is  non-zero
     then prefetching is enabled and if it is zero prefetching is
     disabled.  Likewise whether or not the virtual memory system
     takes advantage of the file system's prefetech can be deter-
     mined with the --RR _f_l_a_g_V_a_l_u_e option; non-zero  means  use  FS
     prefetch, 0 means don't use it.

CCOOPPYY--OONN--WWRRIITTEE
     Copy-on-write can be turned  on  or  off  by  using  the  --CC
     _f_l_a_g_V_a_l_u_e  option.   If  _f_l_a_g_V_a_l_u_e is non-zero then copy-on-
     write is enabled and if it zero copy-on-write is disabled.

MMIISSCCEELLLLAANNEEOOUUSS
     There are two other parameters of the virtual memory  system
     that  can  be  set with vvmmccmmdd.  The number of processes that
     are used to write out dirty pages can be  set  with  the  --pp
     _p_a_g_e_O_u_t_P_r_o_c_s option.  Whether or not memory is freed once it
     gets to the front of the allocate list or it is  left  alone
     until  it  has  to  be  recycled  is  controlled with the --ff
     _f_l_a_g_V_a_l_u_e option; if _f_l_a_g_V_a_l_u_e is non-zero  then  pages  are
     freed  once  they are cleaned and if it is zero pages remain
     on the front of the allocate list after they are cleaned.
