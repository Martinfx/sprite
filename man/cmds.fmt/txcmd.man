     For this command to work correctly, the standard output must
     connect  (eventually) to a ttxx window.  TTxxccmmdd will output the
     _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds to standard output, preceded by an  escape  charac-
     ter,  separated by spaces, and followed by a newline charac-
     ter.  This will cause ttxx to process them as commands, rather
     than  as  data  to be displayed.  There should be no newline
     characters embedded in any of the _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds.
