     --aa             Search  all  man  directories.   By  default,
                    directories  marked  "ALL"  in  the configure
                    file will be skipped.  In Sprite, the --aa flag
                    will  cause Software Warehouse directories to
                    be searched.

     --cc _c_o_n_f_i_g_F_i_l_e  MMaann    normally    looks    in    the    file
                    //sspprriittee//lliibb//mmaann//ccoonnffiigg  for information about
                    where the man pages are.  If the --cc switch is
                    given, then mmaann uses _c_o_n_f_i_g_F_i_l_e instead.

     --ii             Generate index.  Instead of  printing  manual
                    entries, treat each _e_n_t_r_y_N_a_m_e as a file name.
                    Read all the files, and output index informa-
                    tion on standard output.

     --hheellpp          Print a summary of the  command-line  options
                    and exit without printing any manual pages.

     --kk             Keyword search.  Instead of  printing  manual
                    entries,  treat  each _e_n_t_r_y_N_a_m_e argument as a
                    keyword, search the manual indexes for infor-
                    mation  about the keywords, and print all the
                    matching index entries.

     --rr             Normally, mmaann retains formatted  versions  of
                    man  pages  for  faster  printing.   It  only
                    reformats a man page if there is no formatted
                    version  or  if  the source is newer than the
                    formatted version.  This switch causes mmaann to
                    reformat  the  man page even if the formatted
                    copy appears to be up-to-date.

     --ss _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_N_a_m_e Check only  in  section  _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_N_a_m_e  of  the
                    manual for the desired entries.

     --tt             Print  the  manual  entries  on  the  printer
                    instead of on standard output.

     --              MMaann normally filters the  man  pages  through
                    mmoorree  --ss  to  break up the output and process
                    underline and boldface requests.   If  the  --

     The mmaann program locates and prints one or  more  entries  of
     the  Sprite  reference manual.  The entries are given by the
     _e_n_t_r_y_N_a_m_e arguments;  these are usually the  names  of  pro-
     grams  or  library  procedures.   Normally, mmaann searches the
     entire manual and invokes mmoorree to print the first entry that
     matches  each  _e_n_t_r_y_N_a_m_e.   The  manual is divided into sec-
     tions, and it is possible for the same name to be  used  for
     entries in different sections.  You may use the --ss switch to
     specify a particular section;  in this case, mmaann  will  look
     only  in  the named section.  Section names include both the
     traditional UNIX names (11, 22, etc.)  and  the  Sprite  names
     (ccmmddss,  lliibb,  lliibb//cc,  ddeevv, etc.).  You may specify a section
     name without the --ss switch if the section name starts with a
     number and is entered as the first _e_n_t_r_y_N_a_m_e.

     The default configuration file causes the current  directory
     to  be searched for the desired manual entry before the sys-
     tem directories.  If there is a file  _e_n_t_r_y_N_a_m_e..mmaann  in  the
     current  directory, then it will be printed in preference to
     any entries in the system area.

     The --ii switch causes mmaann to generate  an  index  instead  of
     printing a manual page.  Each _e_n_t_r_y_N_a_m_e argument is taken to
     be a file name.  MMaann will read  all  the  files  and  output
     index  information  for  them on standard output.  Normally,
     each  directory  containing  installed  unformatted   manual
     entries  also has a file named iinnddeexx containing index infor-
     mation for all the files in the  directory.   When  printing
     manual  entries,  if  mmaann  cannot  locate a file for a given
     _e_n_t_r_y_N_a_m_e, then it reads the iinnddeexx files to see if _e_n_t_r_y_N_a_m_e
     is  an alternate name for some other manual entry (an alter-
     nate name is any name listed in  the  NNAAMMEE  section  of  the
     entry).

     The --kk switch causes mmaann to perform a keyword search instead
     of printing a manual page.  Each _e_n_t_r_y_N_a_m_e argument is taken
     to be a keyword, and mmaann searches all the  iinnddeexx  files  for
     entries  that  match  the  keywords.  Each matching entry is
     printed on standard output in a human-readable form.  A key-
     word  matches  an index entry if it is a substring of any of
     the entry's name, synopsis, or keyword fields.
