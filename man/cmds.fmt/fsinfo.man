     fsinfo tries to read partition and file  system  information
     from  the  devices  specified on the command line.  It first
     determines the type of the file system, if any, found on the
     device.   If a file system is found, fsinfo reports the type
     of file system, the last domain prefix that the  device  was
     mounted as, the domain number of the file system, the Sprite
     ID of the machine it was last  mounted  on,  and  the  start
     cylinder  and  the  number  of cylinders of the partition on
     which the file system resides.

     Since disk partitions can overlap, fsinfo may find the  same
     file  system  on  two different devices even though the file
     system was created on only one.  If the user sets the  -_v_e_r_-
     _b_o_s_e  option,  fsinfo  reports  an error if a file system is
     found on a different partition than the one it  was  created
     on.  If  no  file  system is found on a device, a message is
     printed to that effect.  Note also  that  fsinfo  prints  an
     error message if the device specifies the entire disk, e.g.,
     /dev/rsd00, since file systems are not created on disks, but
     rather on partitions.
