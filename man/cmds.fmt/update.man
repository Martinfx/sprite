     --bb _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y   Before updating a target, save a backup  copy
                    of the file in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

     --BB _d_a_y_s        Only save the target as a backup copy  if  no
                    backup  exists  or if the target is _d_a_y_s days
                    old.

     --ff             Force:  always update targets  regardless  of
                    last-modified times.

     --gg _g_r_o_u_p       Change the group  of  any  updated  files  to
                    _g_r_o_u_p.   Targets  that  aren't updated do not
                    have their groups changed.

     --hheellpp          Print a summary of the  command-line  options
                    and exit without updating any targets.

     --ll             If a source file  is  a  symbolic  link  then
                    uuppddaattee normally creates an identical symbolic
                    link at the destination.  If the --ll switch is
                    specified, then uuppddaattee copies the file refer-
                    enced by the source  link,  rather  than  the
                    link itself.

     --mm _m_o_d_e        When updating a target,  set  its  protection
                    bits to _m_o_d_e.  Targets that aren't updated do
                    not have their protection changed.  _M_o_d_e must
                    be specified in octal.

     --nn             Be nice about problems with  file  types  not
                    matching (i.e. don't return an error).

     --MM             When updating a target, do it by  moving  the
                    source  instead  of  by copying.  This may be
                    useful when disk space is tight.

     --oo _o_w_n_e_r       Perform all updates as user  _o_w_n_e_r,  so  that
                    newly-created targets will be owned by _o_w_n_e_r.
                    Any targets that are  not  updated  will  not
                    have their _o_w_n_e_r changed.

     --OO             This  option  preserves  ownership  on  newly
                    created  files.   Only  root  or  wheel group
                    members can use this option.                   |

                    Prune  subtress  whose name matches the given  |
                    regular expression.

     --qq             Quiet.  Don't print anything except for error
                    messages.   UUppddaattee  normally prints a message
                    for each file copied.

     --ss             Strip.  Source files are all expected  to  be
                    executable binaries.  When copying, strip all
                    of the symbol and relocation information from
                    the updated target.

     --tt             Instead  of  setting  the  last-accessed  and
                    last-modified  times  of each target to match
                    those of its source,  leave  them  alone,  so
                    that they are set to the current time.

     --vv             Verify.  Don't actually modify any files, but
                    print  information  about  which  files would
                    have been modified.

     --ii             Ignore symbolic links entirely.

     The uuppddaattee command is used to replace out-of-date copies  of
     files with more recent versions.  It operates on one or more
     source files.  For each source, uuppddaattee locates a correspond-
     ing  target;   if  the target doesn't exist, or if the last-
     modified time of the source is later than the  last-modified
     time  of  the target, or if the --ff option is specified, then
     uuppddaattee makes a copy  of  the  source  at  the  target.   The
     target's  last-modified  time  and  permissions  will be set
     identical to those of the source.

     In the simplest case, two file  names  are  given,  both  of
     which  are  regular files.  In this case the first file name
     is the source and the second is the  target.   If  the  last
     file  name  refers  to  a directory, then all the other file
     names (of which there may be more  than  one)  are  sources.
     Each  source  file will be updated to the corresponding file
     _w_i_t_h_i_n the target directory.  For example, in the command

          uuppddaattee //aa//bb cc dd ffoooo
     the target for //aa//bb will be ffoooo//bb, the target for cc will  be
     //ffoooo//cc, and the target for dd will be ffoooo//dd.

     If any of the source files is a directory, then  its  entire
     subtree  will  be updated to the corresponding target, main-
     taining the subtree structure of the source.  In the special
     case where only two file names are given and both are direc-
     tories, then the source is updated _t_o the  target  directory
     rather than _w_i_t_h_i_n it.  Thus, in the command

          uuppddaattee aa bb
     where aa and bb are both directories and aa contains  one  sub-
     directory  cc  which  in turn contains one file dd, the target
     corresponding to aa//cc//dd will be bb//cc//dd.   UUppddaattee  will  create
     the directory bb//cc if it doesn't already exist.

     UUppddaattee will also copy symbolic links.  Normally  it  creates
     matching symbolic links at the targets, but it will copy the
     files pointed to by the links if the --ll switch is given.

     If the target for a source already exists  but  has  a  type
     different  from  the  source (e.g. the target is a directory
     and the source is a regular  file),  then  uuppddaattee  will  not
     modify  the  target.   If the target's last-modified time is
     more recent than the source's, then again  uuppddaattee  will  not
     modify the target.

     There are several restrictions on usage of the --OO, --oo and --gg
     switches.  You may specify --OO only if you are root or in the
     wheel group.  You may specify --gg _g_r_o_u_p as long as you are  a
     member of _g_r_o_u_p.  You may specify --oo _o_w_n_e_r if either

     [1]  You are _o_w_n_e_r (which isn't very interesting).

     [2]  _O_w_n_e_r is rroooott, and you are a member of the wwhheeeell group.

     [3]  There is a group with the same name as  _o_w_n_e_r  and  you
          are a member of that group.

     If you haven't specified the --mm switch, then uuppddaattee attempts
     to  preserve set-user-id bits.  It also attempts to preserve
     set-user-id bits when making backup copies, even if  the  --mm
     switch   was  given.   However,  set-user-id  bits  are  not
     preserved unless the owner of the target file is the same as
     the  owner of the source file (this condition is always true
     if the --OO switch is given).

     If the --bb switch  is  specified,  then  uuppddaattee  attempts  to
     ensure  that  a  backup  copy of the target is saved, if the

     target already exists.  If a backup already exists, then the
     backup  is  overwritten only if the target is relatively old
     (a parameter that defaults to files two weeks old and may be
     overridden by the --BB switch, specifying the requisite age in
     days).  If the --BB switch specifies an age  of  0,  then  the
     most  recent target will always be backed up.  Normally, the
     default of 14 (two weeks)  is  used  to  guarantee  that  an
     unstable file does not overwrite a stable backup.

     The --pp option can be used to prune unwanted  sub-trees  from  |
     the  source files. The argument is a regular expression that  |
     is matched against all source files  before  updating  them.  |
     If  the  expression  matches then the source is not updated.  |
     The expression is matched  against  only  the  tail  of  the  |
     source  path  name, so using an expression of "foo/bar" will  |
     not do what you think it will. If the argument contains  any  |
     magic  characters  such as "*" then you better put it inside  |
     of quotes otherwise csh will glob  it  first.   Multiple  --pp  |
     options  can  be  specified and will be compared against the  |
     source files one at a time.
