DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     When a vvii or eexx editing session is interrupted by a crash of
     the program or the system, eexxpprreesseerrvvee is invoked to save the
     edits that were in progress, so that they can  be  recovered
     by  invoking  vvii  --rr  or  eexx  --rr later on.  If eexxpprreesseerrvvee is
     invoked with no arguments, then it preserves the information
     that it reads from standard input.  If any _a_r_g is specified,
     it preserves all of the edits recorded  in  files  in  //ttmmpp.
     For  more  information than this, read the eexxpprreesseerrvvee and/or
     eexx code.

     This program should not  normally  be  invoked  directly  by
     users;  it is run automatically by the system.
