     This program converts a DVI file to PostScript, and writes
     the result to standard output.  The result requires a small
     amount of PostScript source to precede it to the printer,
     before it can be successfully printed.

                 there may be insufficent memory to hold the
                 information about all of the fonts in the sys-
                 tem.  Portions of the document may be converted
                 by including the -p option on the command line.
                 This will prevent the preloading of all fonts
                 into the system and instead use demand loading
                 of the font tables.

                 of dvi2ps will optionally print statistics about
                 font usage and some other information that is
                 generally only interesting to developers.  On
                 these systems, -s turns on the statistics print-
                 ing.

                 DVI pages are processed in reverse order, with
                 the result that they are stacked in the correct
                 order in the output tray.  This option reverses
                 that.

                 no checking is done.  Note: if your site does
                 not have the complete set of 300 dpi fonts, this
                 option might be disabled.

     TeX output (.dvi files) can be printed directly to most
     printers using the standard _l_p_r(_1) interface, with the --dd
     option to inform it that you are printing a .dvi file.
     _D_v_i_2_p_s is the converter used for PostScript printers inter-
     nally by the line printer daemon, so it (along with the pro-
     logue file) must be installed on the host which spools for
     the printer.

     Not all fonts are available in the resolution needed to
     display on the laser printer;  when a missing font is
     encountered, _d_v_i_2_p_s will continue to process your dvi file,
     and and will log a warning message.  Gaps will appear in the
     document where the missing characters should have been.

     It can take up to 60 seconds for the first page to be out-
     put.  After a head of steam has been built up, it can roll
     along at 5-10 seconds per page.

     Probably too numerous to mention.

     There is likely a limit to the size of documents that can be
     printed (at least, on the Apple LaserWriter).  If you get
     VMerrors reported when printing, use the `-f' and `-t'
     options, to select a range of pages.  The exact limit is
     unknown, but is probably well in excess of 50 pages for
     ``normal'' documents, decreasing with number of different
     fonts used, size of fonts, etc.

     Mark Senn wrote the early versions of this program for the
     BBN BitGraph.  Stephan Bechtolsheim, Bob Brown, Richard
     Furuta, James Schaad and Robert Wells improved it.  Norm
     Hutchinson ported the program to the Sun.  Neal Holtz ported
     it to the Apollo, and then to produce PostScript.  Local
     modifications were done by Van Jacobson of Lawerence Berke-
     ley Laboratory.
