     Copy data from input (either a file or stdin) to stdout  and
     also  to  the listed output files.  The data is not buffered
     and also the data will be copied to stdout even  if  writing
     to  the  output  files  blocks (due to server failure, etc).
     This is useful  for  reading  /dev/syslog  and  sending  the
     stdout  to an X window while copying the data also to a file
     so that you can read the syslog for the  machine  from  any-
     where and not just the console.
