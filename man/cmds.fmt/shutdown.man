     --dd                Enter the debugger after shutting the sys-
                       tem down.

     --ff                Don't  check  the  disks  when  rebooting.
                       Unless  the --dd or --hh options are specified
                       then --ff implies --rr.

     --hh                Force the system to  halt.   This  is  the
                       default  unless  the  --ff or --ss options are
                       used.

     --rr                Reboot instead of  halt.   This  will  use
                       whatever  is  the default reboot string of
                       the hardware.

     --RR _r_e_b_o_o_t_S_t_r      Reboot the system with  _r_e_b_o_o_t_S_t_r  as  the
                       string to reboot with.

     --ww                Don't write the file system cache back  to
                       disk  or to the server.  The default is to
                       write it back.

     --ss                Reboot single user mode. Unless the --dd  or
                       --hh  options  are specified then --ss implies
                       --rr.

     --cc                Reboot a fileserver  as  a  client.   This
                       causes  a  fileserver  to ignore the /boot
                       directory on its local root partition. See
                       the bboooott man page for more details.

     --xx                Causes a fileserver to run rroooottccmmddss before
                       ddiisskkccmmddss on reboot.

     --qq                Do not use _w_a_l_l to announce  the  shutdown
                       and do not pause before shutting down.

     --SS _s_l_e_e_p_T_i_m_e      Sleep  _s_l_e_e_p_T_i_m_e  seconds  after   running
                       _w_a_l_l.

SHUTDOWN                  User Commands                  SHUTDOWN



     the  system  is  halted.  However  the system can be made to
     reboot or enter  the  debugger  by  specifying  the  correct
     options.   By  default,  the  shutdown  is announced (on the
     local host only) using _w_a_l_l and the shutdown is  delayed  by
     several seconds to give people a chance to complain.
