     --pp            (The default.) Print  out  the  prefix  table.
                   With --xx, print the export list of a prefix.

     --xx _p_r_e_f_i_x     Export a local directory given by --ll under the
                   name  _p_r_e_f_i_x,  or  use  with --hh (--HH) to export
                   (not export) the prefix to a particular host.

     --MM _d_e_v_i_c_e     Mount the device under the local name given by
                   the --ll option.  The local name is exported.

     --LL            Use with --MM to prevent exporting the prefix.

     --rr            Mount read-only.  Use with --MM.

     --UU _p_r_e_f_i_x     Unmount the file system with the given prefix.

     --ff            Force the installation  of  the  prefix,  i.e.
                   don't do a stat to make sure the link exists.

     --ll _d_i_r_N_a_m_e    Specifies local name.  Used with --MM (mount) or
                   --xx (export).

     --hh _h_o_s_t       Add _h_o_s_t to the export  list  associated  with
                   the  prefix  given by the --xx option.  _H_o_s_t can
                   either be the name of the server or its Sprite
                   ID.

     --HH _h_o_s_t       Remove _h_o_s_t from the  export  list  associated
                   with  the prefix given by the --xx option.  _H_o_s_t
                   can either be the name of the  server  or  its
                   Sprite ID.

     --aa _p_r_e_f_i_x     Add _p_r_e_f_i_x to the  prefix  table.  If  the  --ss
                   option  is  not given a broadcast will be done
                   to find the server.

     --ss _s_e_r_v_e_r     Specify the server for the prefix given by the
                   --aa  option.   _S_e_r_v_e_r can either be the name of

     --cc _p_r_e_f_i_x     Clear  the  server  binding  for  _p_r_e_f_i_x,  but
                   retain the prefix in the prefix table.

     --dd _p_r_e_f_i_x     Delete _p_r_e_f_i_x  from  the  prefix  table  alto-

     Prefix tables are cached mappings from file name prefixes to
     the  servers that keep files under that prefix.   Under nor-
     mal operation the prefix table is updated automatically as a
     side-effect  of pathname lookup.  The pprreeffiixx command is used
     to display the file system's prefix table, and to manipulate
     its  individual  entries.   If  no options are given, prefix
     prints out the contents of the prefix table (just as if  the
     --pp  switch had been given).  If options are given, then they
     control what happens, as described above.

     The presense of a prefix is indicated by remote links in the
     file system.  A remote link is a circular symbolic link with
     a special type.   They are created via the "ln -r"  command.
     When  a  server  encounters  a remote link during lookup, it
     returns the prefix indicated  by  the  remote  link  to  the
     client that initiated the lookup.  The client loads the pre-
     fix (if it isn't already loaded), broadcasts for the  server
     of  the prefix (if it doesn't already know who that is), and
     then sends the lookup operation to the new server.  Thus the
     root server is bypassed after prefixes are loaded.  Prefixes
     can be nested arbitrarily; remote links  can  occur  in  any
     directory.

     Servers mount local disks under a prefix that gets  exported
     to other Sprite hosts using the -M option.  Servers can con-
     trol what hosts have access to a prefix by adding entries to
     an  export  list using the -h option.  If the export list is
     empty the prefix is exported to all  hosts,  so  adding  one
     exportee effectivly prevents access to all other hosts.
