     This command will output on its standard  output  two  shell
     commands,  which  will  set the TERM and TERMCAP enivornment
     variables to contain correct information for the  ttxx  window
     attached  to  /dev/tty.   For this command to work properly,
     the controlling terminal for the process (/dev/tty) must  be
     attached  to a ttxx window;  ttxxiinnffoo outputs ttxx commands to the
     window and reads back information supplied by ttxx.

     This command is  particularly  useful  in  .login  files  on
     machines  that  do  not have ``tx'' entries in their termcap
     files (and right now there are no machines with "tx" termcap
     entries),  so  that you can rlogin from your workstation and
     get the TERM and TERMCAP environment variables defined.  For
     example,  you  might include the following shell commands in
     your .login files:


          if ( $TERM == tx ) then
               set noglob
               eval `txinfo`
               unset noglob
          endif

     The nnoogglloobb variable must be unset while processing  the  the
     TERMCAP entry because it contains special characters like [[,
     which will confuse the shell unless nnoogglloobb is set.
