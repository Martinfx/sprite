     This command  prints  out  information  about  what  clients
     attempted  recovery  with  a  server,  how  many  times they
     attempted it, and how long it took to recover.  For now, the
     command  must  be  executed  on the server in question.  The
     first line, per host, gives the  duration  of  recovery  for
     that host, while further lines per host (if -duration is not
     specified) give the start and finish times of each  recovery
     attempt,  including  the  first.  The first line is included
     simply for convenience of interpretation.
