     _S_n_m is similar to _n_m except that it operates on SPUR object
     files.  _S_n_m prints the name list (symbol table) of each
     object _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e in the argument list.  If an argument is an
     archive, a listing for each object file in the archive will
     be produced.  If no _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is given, the symbols in _a._o_u_t
     are listed.

     Each symbol name is preceded by its value (blanks if unde-
     fined) and one of the letters:

     AA    absolute

     BB    bss segment symbol

     CC    common symbol

     DD    data segment symbol

     TT    text segment symbol

     UU    undefined

     --    debug, giving symbol table entries (see --aa below)

     The type letter is upper case if the symbol is external, and
     lower case if it is local.  Symbols given values in shared
     regions are followed by `S' or `s'.  By default, the output
     is sorted alphabetically by symbol name.

     --gg   Print only global (external) symbols.

     --nn   Sort numerically rather than alphabetically.

     --oo   Prepend file or archive element name to each output
          line rather than only once.

     --pp   Don't sort; print in symbol-table order.

     --rr   Sort in reverse order.

     --uu   Print only undefined symbols.

     --aa   Print all symbols.
