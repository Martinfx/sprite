          Sets the interval at which the count of available hosts
          is updated. Default is 15 seconds.

     --ff   Display file system cache size.

     --vv   Display amount of physical memory devoted to user  vir-
          tual memory.

     --%%   Display cache size (--ff) or VM size (--vv) as a percentage
          of main memory.

     --MM   Display cache size (--ff) or VM size (--vv) in megabytes.

     --pp   Display the number of page-ins (in 100's).  This  is  a
          sum of text, heap, and stack page-ins.

     --PP   Display the number of pages written out to  swap  files
          (in 100's).

     --ii   Display the number of  ethernet  packets  received  (in
          100's).

     --oo   Display the number of ethernet  packets  sent  out  (in
          100's).

     --ddiisskkss
          Display disk statistics for all  disks  in  the  system
          (superceeds -D).

     --DD _n_u_m
          Display disk #_n_u_m utilization on a scale  from  0.0  to
          1.0.

     --rr   Display the number of disk read transfers  (in  100's).
          Use with --DD or --ddiisskkss.

     --ww   Display the number of disk write transfers (in  100's).
          Use with --DD or --ddiisskkss.

     This widget displays operating system parameters as  a  run-
     ning  graph.   It  is an X toolkit widget and so it needs to
     run under the X window system.  This is a  ``load  widget'',
     which  displays  a  value  every _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l seconds, and has a
     title but no vertical scale.  Instead, horizontal lines  are
     drawn to represent increments in the native unit of whatever
     is being displayed.  For some parameters, like percentage of
     memory devoted to the file system cache, the displayed value
     is always between 0 and 1 so there are no  horizontal  scale
     lines.   For the megabytes of filesystem cache there will be
     horizontal  lines  that  represent  megabytes,  for   remote
     processes  there  will be horizontal lines to represent 10's
     of remote processes, and  for  paging  and  network  traffic
     there will be horizontal lines to represent 100's of events.
     The value displayed is truncated to the largest  value  that
     can  be  displayed  without  causing the horizontal lines to
     completely occupy the display.  This value is equal to  half
     the pane height.

     Several system parameters can be viewed at  once;  the  load
     meters are organized into a vertical pane with each meter of
     equal height.  It is best to let spritemon determine its own
     geometry  at  startup  (it  will use the default pane height
     times the number of parameters being displayed), or you  can
     specify  a  geometry  argument on the command line and spri-
     temon will evenly divide the window into panes.   Otherwise,
     if  you drag out a window size, the VPane widget does a poor
     job of picking the heights of individual panes.

     The disk related options only work on machines  with  disks.
     The  --DD  option  specifies which disk to display information
     about, or --ddiisskkss can be used to  display  information  about
     all  the disks in the system.  Utilization is displayed, and
     --rr and --ww are used to display raw  read  and  write  counts.

     The  number  to  specify to --DD corresponds to a kernel table
     entry that is indexed starting at zero.

BBUUGGSS
     The --ii option needs to  be  glommed  together  with  another
     option,  i.e.  --iioo,  or it gets interpreted by the X toolkit
     and sspprriitteemmoonn starts out iconic.

     The value of the argument to --DD is un-intuitive.

     The disk information should display the  file  system  name,
     but kernel support is needed for this.
