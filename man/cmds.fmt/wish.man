                    Display (and screen) on which to display win-
                    dow.

     --ffiillee _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e Read commands from _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e rather than stan-
                    dard  input.   The  last  element in _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e
                    will be used as the title for the application
                    and name of its interpreter for sseenndd commands
                    (unless overridden by the --nnaammee option).

     --ggeeoommeettrryy _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
                    Initial geometry to use for window.

     --nnaammee _n_a_m_e     Use _n_a_m_e as the title to be displayed in  the
                    window,  and  as  the name of the interpreter
                    for sseenndd commands.

     --ssyynncc          Execute all X server commands  synchronously,
                    so  that  errors  are  reported  immediately.
                    This will result in  much  slower  execution,
                    but it is useful for debugging.

     --hheellpp          Print a summary of the  command-line  options
                    and exit.

     WWiisshh is a simple  program  consisting  of  the  Tcl  command
     language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads com-
     mands from standard input  or  from  a  file.   If  wwiisshh  is
     invoked  with  no  arguments,  it creates a small window and
     reads Tcl commands interactively from  standard  input.   It
     will  continue  processing  commands  until all windows have
     been deleted or until end-of-file  is  reached  on  standard
     input.

     If the --ffiillee option is provided to Tk,  then  it  reads  Tcl
     commands  from  the  file  named in the --ffiillee option.  These
     commands will normally create an interactive interface  con-
     sisting of one or more widgets.  When the end of the command
     file is reached, wwiisshh will continue to respond to  X  events
     until all windows have been deleted.

     The wwiisshh program provides a few Tcl commands in addition  to
     those  already  provided  by the Tcl and Tk libraries.  How-
     ever, these commands are  intended  for  debugging  purposes
     only  and  should  not  be widely used.  In particular, they
     will probably be eliminated in some future release.  If  you
     wish  to  use these commands you'll have to read the code to
     see what they do.
