     The kkiilllleexxpprr command is used to  a  user's  processes  whose
     command  line  contains one of a set of regular expressions.
     The regular expression arguments are 'or'ed together to form
     a  single  expression  that compared to the command lines of
     the user's processes.  If a match is found  the  process  is
     sent  a  SIGTERM  signal, followed by a SIGKILL signal.  The
     expression arguments are often simple strings,  but  can  be
     more  complex regular expressions of the form found in Perl.
     A process will be killed even if the expression matches only
     part  of  a  word.  If  you  want the expression to match an
     entire word in the command line then you should surround the
     argument with spaces.

     killexpr foo bar
          Kills all processes that have either the pattern  'foo'
          or the pattern 'bar' in their command line.

     killexpr '^foo'
          Kills all processes whose command line starts with  the
          pattern 'foo'.
