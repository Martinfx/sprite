                   whatever  buffer  is  provided  by  the  stdio
                   library.   This  option  has  no effect if the

     --rroooottPPaarrtt     This option controls the output to a file.  If
                   the  --oouuttppuuttFFiillee option is not given then this
                   option has no effect. Otherwise, the output is
                   stored  in  a  buffer  and only written to the
                   file when the program exits.  This allows  the
                   output  to  be written to a file on the parti-
                   tion being  checked  (usually  the  output  is
                   written  to  the root partition).  The file IO
                   in this case is very  primative  and  restric-
                   tive.  The  output  file  must  be in the root
                   directory and  must  exist  prior  to  running
                   ffsscchheecckk.   If  the  size of the output exceeds
                   the size of the file or if it exceeds the size
                   of  the  direct  data  blocks  then it will be
                   truncated. If the output exceeds the  size  of
                   the  internal buffer it will be truncated (see
                   --bbuuffffeerrSSiizzee ).  If the output is smaller  than
                   the  size  of  the file, the remaining part of
                   the file will be filled with null  characters.
                   Any  file  produced by this option will have a
                   decimal  number  in  the  first   line   which
                   represents  the  number  of bytes in the file.
                   This is  used  by  ffsscchheecckk  to  calculate  the
                   starting point for appending.  The output file
                   can be  reset  by  either  setting  the  first
                   number  to  0  or by overwriting the file with
                   null characters.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This program will perform a consistency check on a file sys-
     tem.   By  default  it will report inconsistencies but won't
     repair them.  If the --wwrriittee option  is  used  then  it  will
     repair  any  inconsistencies by modifying the disk as neces-
     sary.

     This program performs the following consistency checks:

     1.   It makes sure that the file descriptor  allocation  bit
          map  agrees  with  the  status information kept in each
          file descriptor.  If necessary it will correct the  bit
          map.

     2.   It confirms that data-block and indirect-block pointers
          are valid.  If a pointer is invalid then the pointer is
          set to NIL and the file size is adjusted  as  necessary
          to reflect the new size of the file.

     3.   It recreates the data block allocation bit map based on
          information   in  the  file  descriptors  and  indirect
          blocks.

     4.   It checks for blocks that are allocated  to  more  than
          one  file. If a block is multiply allocated then copies
          of the block are made and all but one of the  files  is
          corrected  to  use  a  copy.   If the --ddeelleettee option is
          given, or if only a subset of the fragments in a  block
          are  shared, then the block is given to the lowest num-
          bered file descriptor and it is removed from all  other
          files  that  reference  it.   A special case is made of
          block 0. This block belongs to the root  directory  and
          is  copied (or deleted) for all other files even if the

          root directory is corrupted or doesn't exist.

     5.   It verifies that directories are of the proper  format.
          In  order  to  patch a directory, names may be deleted,
          the directory may be truncated, or in  the  worst  case
          the directory may be turned into a normal file.

     6.   It puts unreferenced files into the  lost+found  direc-
          tory.   The  name of each file in the lost+found direc-
          tory is the file's file descriptor number.

     7.   It corrects link counts and block counts in  each  file
          descriptor.

     8.   It checks that indirect blocks contain valid  pointers.
          If  the pointers are invalid and the block is part of a
          file then a hole is created, otherwise if the block  is
          part of a directory then the directory is truncated.

     9.   It checks that each file descriptor  contains  a  valid
          magic  number.  If  this  is not the case then the file
          descriptor is cleared and marked as unused in the  bit-
          map.

     10.  It recreates the root directory if it is corrupted  and
          the --ffiixxRRoooott option is given.

     By default only terse information is given about the  errors
     in  the  file  system.   Only  the  first  error per file is
     reported.  If the --vveerrbboossee option is given then more verbose
     information  will be given.  If the --bbiittmmaappVVeerrbboossee option is
     given then differences between the bitmaps on disk  and  the
     recreated bitmaps are printed. Since the bitmaps on disk are
     not kept current use of this option  is  likely  to  produce
     lots of output.

     The ffsscchheecckk program will also perform other actions  depend-
     ing  on  the options that are specified.  If the --iinnccVVeerrssiioonn
     option is given then flags in the  file  system  header  are
     checked  to  see  if the file system was safely written back
     when it was detached or the system  went  down.   If  it  is
     determined  that the file system was not safely written back
     then the version numbers for all files in  the  file  system
     are  incremented.   This  will  cause  all  reopens of files
     because of recovery to fail.

     If the --ffiixxRRoooott option is given the root directory  will  be
     recreated  if  it  has  become  corrupted.   If  the root is
     recreated, then any directories that have the root directory
     as  their  parent  will be inserted into the root with their
     file descriptor number as their name.  Any files  that  used
     to  be  in  the root directory will be placed in lost+found.

     FFsscchheecckk assumes that data block 0 belongs to the root direc-
     tory  and  will  allocate  this  block to the directory when
     reconstructing it.  The --ffiixxRRoooott option requires reading the
     root  directory  twice,  hence it cannot be used without the
     --wwrriittee option.

     The --cclleeaarr option should be used if the domain number  field
     should be cleared from the summary sector.  Each file system
     that is attached is given a domain number under which it can
     be  identified.   When a file system is attached, the system
     will try to attach it with the same domain  number  that  it
     was  attached  under  last  time.  This is required to allow
     clients of the file system to recover when the  file  system
     is  reattached.   If the domain number field is cleared from
     the summary sector, then the system  will  attach  the  file
     system under a domain number of the system's choosing.

     The --hhoossttIIDD option will force the system to update the  host
     id in the file system header.  If the device under which the
     file system is being attached is generic then the id of  the
     host on which ffsscchheecckk is run is used.  Otherwise the host id
     specified by the device file is used.  The default is not to
     modify the host id.

     The --bbaaddBBlloocckk option will  initialize  the  file  descriptor
     which points to bad disk blocks.  Initializing it will clear
     out any pointers to bad blocks that  are  currently  in  the
     file descriptor.

     The --hheeaappLLiimmiitt option can be used to place an upper limit on
     the  size  of  the program heap. This can be used to prevent
     paging, since paging cannot be done at the point in the boot
     sequence  when  ffsscchheecckk  is run.  If ffsscchheecckk cannot complete
     checking the disk because of the limit then it  will  do  as
     much  as  it can. This should allow multiple runs of ffsscchheecckk
     to completely check the disk.  The limit is only an approxi-
     mation  of  how  large  ffsscchheecckk will grow, since the program
     stack is not restricted. Therefore the limit should  be  set
     as high as possible but it should not be set to the boundary
     at which paging will occur. If it  is  set  too  small  then
     ffsscchheecckk may not be able to run at all. Note that the bbuuffffeerr--
     SSiizzee and rreeaaddBBlloocckk options will affect the  amount  of  heap
     required.   As  a  rule  of  thumb, the amount of heap space
     needed by ffsscchheecckk is proportional to the disk size  and  the
     amount of errors on the disk. A heap limit of 1 Mb should be
     sufficient for all but the most extreme cases.

     Each time ffsscchheecckk runs and finds an error in a partition,  a
     counter on disk is incremented. The value of this counter is
     the number of consecutive times ffsscchheecckk has run on the  par-
     tition  and  corrected  an error. If the counter exceeds the
     value given by the --nnuummRReebboooott  option  (default  4)  and  if

     ffsscchheecckk   corrects   an  error,  then  ffsscchheecckk  will  return
     EXIT_NOREBOOT instead of the standard soft error indication.
     This  allows  higher level software to avoid infinite reboot
     loops.

     The --cclleeaarrFFiixxCCoouunntt option resets the consecutive counter  to
     0.

     Finally, the --oouuttppuutt, --bbuuffffeerrSSiizzee and --nnooFFlluusshh options  con-
     trol  the output from fscheck. The --oouuttppuutt option allows the
     output from fscheck to be put into a file as well as printed
     on  stdout and stderr.  The --bbuuffffeerrSSiizzee option sets the size
     of the IO buffer  associated  with  the  output  file.   The
     --nnooFFlluusshh option prevents the buffer from being flushed until
     the disk has been checked and  corrected.  This  allows  the
     output to be written to the disk being checked.  If the out-
     put exceeds the size of the buffer then it is  truncated  to
     the buffer size.  If the buffer size is exceeded in the mid-
     dle of an output string, then remainder of the  string  will
     wrap over the beginning of the buffer.

     Indirect blocks are always marked as in use in  the  bitmap,
     even  if  they  contain invalid entries. This is because the
     block may be in use by another file and cannot be marked  as
     free.

     The --ffiixxRRoooott  option  cannot  be  used  without  the  --wwrriittee
     option.
