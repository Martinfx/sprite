     --MM _n_u_m_C_l_i_e_n_t_s Run as master of the number of  clients  indi-
                   cated.   The  master  bench  process should be
                   started before any slaves.

     --SS            Run as a slave.  Use --cc to specify a  command.
                   The  slave  process  will wait until all other
                   slaves have registered with the master  before
                   executing their benchmark.

     --cc _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _a_r_g_s ...
                   Follow this with  the  command  to  benchmark.
                   Execution  search  paths  are  not used (yet).
                   The command can be followed with any  required
                   arguments.

     --pp            Name of the pseudo-device used  for  coordina-
                   tion.

     --oo _o_u_t_f_i_l_e    Output file in which execution statistics  are
                   placed.

     --ff            Flush the file system cache  before  executing
                   the benchmark.

     --xx            Disable all system  tracing  before  executing
                   the benchmark.

     --hh            Enable taking of RPC timing histograms.   This
                   is ok with -x.

     --dd            Don't sync the file system cache at the end of
                   the  benchmark.   Normally  this is done after
                   the benchmark completes and  before  the  file
                   system I/O statistics are taken.

     --ss            Use  signals  instead  of  pseudo-devices  for
                   rendez-vous.

     --PP _s_e_c_o_n_d_s    Pause for  some  seconds  before  getting  the
                   final  statistics.  Only applies to the master
                   bench process.

     --ww            Causes the master process to wait for  a  USR1
                   signal  before  it  allows the slaves to begin
                   running.  This option must be used with the -_M
                   option, and cannot be used with the -_s option.

     Bench is a harness for other programs that executes them and
     takes  system  statistics.  The command to benchmark follows
     the --cc option.  Currently bench does not used the  execution
     search  path,  so  the  command  has to be a valid pathname.
     (This should be fixed!) In its simplest form (no --SS  or  --MM)
     bench  executes  a  single  process  and generates output to
     ``bench.out'' or to the file specified  by  the  -o  option.
     The  default  behavior  is  that  the execution time and CPU
     utilization are recorded after the benchmarked process  com-
     pletes,  then the file system cache is written back and file
     system statistics are recorded.  The file system  cache  can
     be  flushed  before  the benchmark using the --ff option.  The
     cache write-back at the end of the run can be disabled  with
     the --dd option.  The --xx option turns off various kernel trac-
     ing that can slow down execution.

     Multiple processes can be coordinated using the  --MM  and  --SS
     options.   First  a master bench process is started with the
     --MM option.  This option is followed by an integer that indi-
     cates  the  number  of slaves to expect.  The master process
     creates a pseudo-device that will be used to coordinate  the
     slaves.   Each  slave  benchmark  is  started  using  the --SS
     option.  The slaves contact the master, and after  they  all
     make contact the master lets them proceed.  The master bench
     process also takes system statistics during the execution of
     all  the  slaves.  It is generally run on the file server in
     order to measure the load presented  by  the  slaves.   Note
     that the master doesn't run a command itself, so no --cc argu-
     ment is needed with --MM.
