     sysstat - print statistics and information about  the  state
     of the system

     --vv            Print out the  compilation  version  timestamp
                   for  the  kernel.   This  is the default if no
                   options are specified.

     --cc            Print out the number of times each system call
                   has been invoked.

     --pp _n          Enable or disable system call timing.

     --tt            For each system  call,  print  the  number  of
                   calls and how much time was required.

     --RR            Reset the count and time information for  sys-
                   tem calls.

     This command prints out  statistics  and  other  information
     about the system.

     --vv   By default,  ssyyssssttaatt  prints  the  compilation  version
          timestamp  for the kernel.  This is a unique identifier
          indicating who compiled  the  kernel  and  when.   This
          information  is printed if no options are specified, or
          if the -_v  option is specified.

     --cc   This option indicates that  ssyyssssttaatt  should  display  a
          count  of the number of times each system call has been
          invoked.  For each call, the number of  invocations  is
          printed  along  with an indication of whether the call,
          if done by a migrated process, would be handled locally
          or would require action by the process's _h_o_m_e _n_o_d_e.

     --tt   This option tells ssyyssssttaatt to display  for  each  system
          call  the  number  of  times  the call was invoked, the
          total time spent in that call,  and  the  average  time
          spent  in  that  call.   Note  that  if  a  process  is
          migrated, its system calls are  recorded  by  the  host
          that  it is executing on, rather than by the home node.
          Normally system call timing is turned off; use  the  --pp

          option to turn it on.

     --RR   This option causes ssyyssssttaatt reset the kernel's count  of
          the  number of times each system call has been invoked,
          as well as the accumulated time for each  system  call.
          Thus,  subsequent invocations of ssyyssssttaatt with the --cc or
          --tt option will report only activity since  the  invoca-
          tion with the --RR option.

     --pp   This option controls whether Sprite keeps track of  how
          much  time  each  system call takes.  To turn on system
          call timing, use --pp 11; to turn it off, use --pp 00.

     System call timing is only available on ds5000s.
