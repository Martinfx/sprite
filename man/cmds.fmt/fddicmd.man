     --rreesseett
          Reset the adapter.

     --hhaalltt
          Halt the adapter.

     --fflluusshh
          Flush the driver's transmit queue of waiting packets.

     --aaddddrr
          Print the adapter's network address.

     --ddeebbuugg
          Toggle debugging.  Messages are printed to the syslog.

     --ssttaattss
          Print adapter statistics.

     --eecchhoo SSpprriitteeIIDD
          Echo packets off of the specified host.

     --eerrrrlloogg
          Print the internal and external error  codes  that  the
          adapter  writes as it halts.  Should be zero for normal
          operation.

     --ssyysslloogg
          Print info onto syslog instead of terminal.

     The rreesseett and hhaalltt options control the adapter's  connection
     to the ring. The rreesseett option resets the adapter, connecting
     it back to the ring.  The hhaalltt  option  halts  the  adapter,
     disconnecting it from the ring.


     The fflluusshh option flushes the driver's transmit queue.


     The aaddddrr option prints out the adapter's network address  in
     the standard aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff form.


     The ddeebbuugg option toggles debugging output.  The messages are
     written  to  the  syslog,  and really slow down the adapter.
     Useful for seeing how the adapter works.


     The ssttaattss option prints out  adapter  statistics.  It  first
     reports  the  number of packets and bytes sent and received.
     Then comes an array of receive reaped numbers.   Each  array
     slot  denotes a number of received packets, and the value in
     that slot is the number of times that the driver reaped that
     number  of  packets  in one interrupt.  Following this is an
     array counting packet sizes, both sent and received.


     The eecchhoo, ssiizzee, and rreeppeeaatt options let hosts be pinged  over
     FDDI.   The  argument  to eehhccoo is the Sprite ID of a host to
     ping.  The argument to ssiizzee controls the size of the RPC  to
     ping with.  And rreeppeeaatt controls the number of times the host
     is echoed.  Timing numbers are reported when the echoes fin-
     ish.


     The rreegg and eerrrrlloogg options print out some of  the  adapter's
     internal   state.   rreegg  prints  out  the  contents  of  the
     adapter's registers.  eerrrrlloogg prints  out  the  internal  and
     external  error  codes written by the adapter when it halts.
     These codes should be zero during normal operation.


     The ssyysslloogg option was intended to  control  whethere  output
     would  be  printed  on  the  syslog  or on the terminal that
     invoked ffddddiiccmmdd.  This is only partially supported.
