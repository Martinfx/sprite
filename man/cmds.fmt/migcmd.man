     --ss                  A message is  printed  to  indicate  the
                         status   of  process  migration  on  the
                         current host,  including  the  migration
                         level  and  the  conditions  under which
                         migration is permitted.

     --SS                  Migration statistics are printed.  These
                         include  such values as the average time
                         to migrate an active process, the  aver-
                         age  time  to perform a remote exec, and
                         the total number  of  migrations,  evic-
                         tions, and remote execs performed.

                         root.)

     --EE                  Change the export restrictions for  pro-

                         root.)

     --ii                  Change whether idle time  is  considered
                         when  determining  the  availability  of
                         this host.  (The caller must be root.)

     --ll                  Change  whether  load  average  is  con-
                         sidered  when determining the availabil-
                         ity of this host.  (The caller  must  be
                         root.)

                         printed.   The  number of records may be
                         altered by the --PP option.

     --PP _n_u_m_R_e_c_s          The number of trace records to print  is
                         modified  to  be  _n_u_m_R_e_c_s.   This option
                         must be used with the --pp option.

     This command is used to perform functions related to process
     migration.   MMiiggccmmdd  is normally used to print the status of
     process  migration  availability  or  migration  statistics.
     MMiiggccmmdd  may  also be used to restrict which users may export
     or import processes from or to the local  host  (the  caller
     must  be  root to do so); change whether load average and/or
     idle time are considered when deciding whether  the  current
     host is available for imports; print process migration trace
     records; enable or  disable  tracing  of  process  migration
     activity;  or set the kernel's migration ``debugging level''
     or ``migration version''.

MMIIGGRRAATTIIOONN SSTTAATTEE
     MMiiggccmmdd prints the status of process  migration  availability
     if  the  --ss  flag is specified.  As root, one may modify the
     restrictions on process migration.  For both  exporting  and
     importing  processes,  root may choose to restrict migration
     to processes owned by root, or not allow migration  at  all,
     or  allow all users to migrate.  These options are specified
     to the --EE and --II flags as rroooott, nnoonnee, and aallll  respectively.
     In  addition, root is permitted to instruct the llooaaddaavvgg dae-
     mon whether to consider idle time and/or load  average  when
     announcing  the  availability  of  the host for importation.
     These options are --ii  and  --ll,  respectively,  and  take  an
     integer  argument:  11 specifies that the criterion should be
     ignored, and 00 specifies that it should be considered.

SSTTAATTIISSTTIICCSS
     The --SS flag causes MMiiggccmmdd  to print statistics on its  stan-
     dard  output.   These  statistics change too rapidly to list
     the  format  here.   The   format   is   (hopefully)   self-
     explanatory.

TTRRAACCIINNGG
     The --pp flag may be used  to  dump  process  migration  trace
     records.   The maximum number of records defaults to 200 but
     may be modified with the --PP option.  By default, tracing  is
     disabled  and  no  trace records will be printed.  To enable

     tracing, one may specify the --tt flag, and to disable it, one
     may specify the --TT flag.

     The kernel's debug  level  may  be  modified  using  the  --dd
     option.  Subsequently higher values for the debug level will
     cause more debugging statements to be executed. For example,
     to have no migration debugging enabled whatsoever, the level
     may be set to 0.  To enable  error  messages  that  indicate
     unusual  but  non-fatal  events, the level may be 2 (this is
     the current default).  To enable  more  messages  about  the
     internal  operation  of migration within the kernel, such as
     forwarded system calls, the level may be set to values  from
     3-10.  ``Less interesting'' events are conditioned on higher
     values of the debug level.

MMIIGGRRAATTIIOONN VVEERRSSIIOONN
     The kernel's migration version may be modified by root using
     the --VV  option.  This should be done only when the kernel is
     compiled with an incorrect version for some reason, in order
     to  cause  the  kernel  to be compatible vis-a-vis migration
     with a different class of kernels.
