     This command is used to provide user access to the migration
     load  average  and  idle  time  database.  It may be used to
     retrieve information about the local host or  all  hosts  on
     the  network,  invalidate entries in the migration database,
     or evict foreign processes.   The  default  for  llooaaddaavvgg  if
     invoked with no arguments is to list the load average of the
     local host.  This is also true if the program is invoked  as
     llaa  or  uuppttiimmee,  which are synonyms to make llooaaddaavvgg somewhat
     compatible with UNIX.  If the program is invoked  as  _e_v_i_c_t,
     the default is to evict foreign processes.

     --aa   When invoked with the --ll flag, or  with  no  arguments,
          llooaaddaavvgg  will print a line containing information about
          the local host. The --aa flag is used to list information
          about  all  hosts.  Each  line  contains  the hostname;
          machine type;  machine  status;  migration  status;  1-
          minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute weighted load averages;
          and time since input was last received at the  console,
          for   idle   hosts.   Times   are  given  in  the  form
          ``days+hours:minutes''.  For hosts  that  are  running,
          the  machine status is listed as ``up'' followed by the
          time since they last rebooted.  The migration status is
          ``inuse''  for  hosts  with  one  or  more active local
          users, ``avail''  for  hosts  that  are  available  for
          migration,  ``hasmig''for hosts that are currently run-
          ning processes that are migrated from other hosts,  and
          ``refuses''  for  hosts  that are idle but are refusing
          migration (perhaps because they are running an incompa-
          tible  version  of the kernel, or because they are file
          servers). In addition, for  hosts  that  are  currently
          available for migration from the host invoking llooaaddaavvgg,
          a ** is printed next to the hostname.  After the  migra-
          tion  status,  llooaaddaavvgg lists the weighted load averages

          and time since last input.  Note: idle  times  of  less
          than  the  threshold  for  permitting migration are not
          listed, and input from remote logins  does  not  affect
          host   idle  time.   Finally,  the  machine  status  is
          ``down'' for hosts that are not currently  running,  in
          which  case  the  host is listed with the time since it
          was last running.

     --ZZ _h_o_s_t ...
          To invalidate the entries for one or more hosts in  the
          shared  migration  database, invoke llooaaddaavvgg with the --ZZ
          option, followed by the names of the hosts  to  invali-
          date.   This  may be used if a host is removed from the
          network, for example.  Hosts that are  not  invalidated
          but  are  down  indefinitely will appear in the list of
          hosts as being down.

EEVVIICCTTIIOONN
     --EE   Running llooaaddaavvgg with the --EE option causes it  to  evict
          foreign  processes as though the machine were no longer
          idle.  If llooaaddaavvgg is invoked by the name _e_v_i_c_t,   evic-
          tion  is  the default operation.  Eviction is performed
          by invoking an ioctl on the pseudo-device corresponding
          to the host-specific mmiiggdd daemon.
