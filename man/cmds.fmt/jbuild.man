DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     JJbbuuiilldd is a system manager's utility for the Jaquith system.
     It's purpose is to rebuild Jaquith's disk index from tape in
     the event of disk crash.


     Jbuild processes  a  single  Jaquith  tape  by  restoring  a
     sequence  of index (thdr) file, parsing them, and rebuilding
     the tree structure on disk.  Several arguments  control  the
     details  of  the restoration: The --ffiirrsstt and -last arguments
     limit the range of thdr files which are read from tape.  The
     --mmaattcchhppaatthh argument restricts restoration to user file path-
     names which match _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e.  The  --nnooiinnddeexx  option  inhibits
     the rebuilding of the disk index entirely; only the raw thdr
     files are restored.


     Jbuild is not network-aware since  it  is  not  for  use  by
     clients.  It  assumes  that  it  has  direct  access  to the
     readers.


     _d_a_t_e is of the form _D_a_t_e_S_p_e_c[:_T_i_m_e_S_p_e_c]. _T_i_m_e_S_p_e_c is of  the
     form   [hh[:mm[:ss]]],   and   _D_a_t_e_S_p_e_c   is   of  the  form
     dd-month[-yyyy]. Month is the first 3 letters of the  month;
     all  others  are  numbers. The '/' character is a substitute
     for '-' and '.' may be used instead of ':'.


FFIILLEESS
     Jbuild creates a temporary work file  in  the  Jaquith  root
     called   rebuild._p_i_d.   The   work   file  will  be  renamed
     _a_r_c_h/thdr._n_u_m_b_e_r after the thdr file has  been  restored  to
     its  archive,  or  thdr._p_i_d._c_o_u_n_t, if the file appears to be
     bogus.


BBUUGGSS
     Jbuild can restore only one volume at a time; several  invo-
     cations  may  be  necessary  to  restore  an  entire logical
     archive.
