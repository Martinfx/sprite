DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     _X_d_v_i is a program which runs under the X window system. It
     is used to preview DVI files, such as are produced by TeX.

     This program has the capability of showing the file shrunken
     by various (integer) factors, and also has a ``magnifying
     glass'' which allows one to see a small part of the unshrunk
     image momentarily.

     Before displaying any page or part thereof, it checks to see
     if the dvi file has changed since the last time it was
     displayed.  If this is the case, then _x_d_v_i will reinitialize
     itself for the new dvi file.  For this reason, exposing
     parts of the _x_d_v_i window while _T_e_X is running should be
     avoided.  This feature allows you to preview many versions
     of the same file while running _x_d_v_i only once.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     In addition to specifying the .ddvvii file (with or without the
     .ddvvii), _X_d_v_i supports the following command line options.  If
     the option begins with a `++' instead of a `--', the option is
     restored to its default value.  By default, these options
     can be set via the resource names given in parentheses in
     the description of each option.

     +ppaaggee
          Specifies the first page to show.  If + is given
          without a number, the last page is assumed; the first
          page is the default.

     --ss _s_h_r_i_n_k
          (.shrinkFactor) Defines the initial shrink factor.  The
          default value is 3.

     --SS _d_e_n_s_i_t_y
          (.densityPercent) Determines the density used when
          shrinking bitmaps for fonts.  A higher value produces a
          lighter font.  The default value is 40.

     --pp _p_i_x_e_l_s
          (.pixelsPerInch) Defines the size of the fonts to use,

          in pixels per inch.  The default value is 300.

     --aallttffoonntt _f_o_n_t
          (.altFont) Declares a default font to use when the font
          in the dvi file cannot be found.  This is useful, for
          example, with PostScript <tm> fonts.

     --ll   (.listFonts) Causes the names of the fonts used to be
          listed.

     --rrvv  (.reverseVideo) Causes the page to be displayed with
          white characters on a black background, instead of vice
          versa.

     --bbww _w_i_d_t_h
          (.borderWidth) Specifies the width of the border of the
          window.

     --bboorrddeerrwwiiddtthh _w_i_d_t_h
          Same as --bbww, above.

     --ffgg _c_o_l_o_r
          (.foreground) Determines the color of the text (fore-
          ground).

     --ffoorreeggrroouunndd _c_o_l_o_r

     --bbgg _c_o_l_o_r
          (.background) Determines the color of the background.

     --bbaacckkggrroouunndd _c_o_l_o_r
          Same as --bbgg, above.

     --hhll _c_o_l_o_r
          (.highlight) Determines the color of the page border.

     --bbdd _c_o_l_o_r
          (.borderColor) Determines the color of the window bord-
          er.

     --ccrr _c_o_l_o_r
          (.cursorColor) Determines the color of the cursor.  The
          default is the foreground color.

     --tthhoorroouugghh
          (.thorough) _X_d_v_i will usually try to ensure that over-
          strike characters (_e._g.  \notin) are printed correctly.
          On monochrome displays, this is always possible with
          one logical operation, either _a_n_d or _o_r.  On color
          displays, however, this may take two operations, one to
          set the appropriate bits and one to clear other bits.

          If this is the case, then by default _x_d_v_i will instead
          use the _c_o_p_y operation, which does not handle over-
          striking correctly.  The ``thorough'' option chooses
          the slower but more correct choice.  See also -_c_o_p_y,
          below.

     --ccooppyy
          (.copy) Always use the _c_o_p_y operation when writing
          characters to the display.  This option may be neces-
          sary for correct operation on a color display, but
          overstrike characters will be incorrect.

     --mmaarrggiinnss _i_n_c_h_e_s
          (.margins) Specifies the size of both the top margin
          and side margin.  This can be a decimal number, _e._g.,
          1.5.  It determines the ``home'' position of the page
          within the window as follows.  If the entire page fits
          in the window, then the margin settings are ignored.
          If, even after removing the margins from the left,
          right, top, and bottom, the page still cannot fit in
          the window, then the page is put in the window such
          that the top and left margins are hidden, and presum-
          ably the upper left-hand corner of the text on the page
          will be in the upper left-hand corner of the window.
          Otherwise, the text is centered in the window.  See
          also `MM' under the KEYSTROKES section.

     --ssiiddeemmaarrggiinn _i_n_c_h_e_s
          (.sideMargin) Specifies the side margin (see above).

     --ttooppmmaarrggiinn _i_n_c_h_e_s
          (.topMargin) Specifies the top and bottom margins (see
          above).

     --ppaappeerr _p_a_p_e_r_t_y_p_e
          (.paper) Specifies the size of the printed page.  This
          may be of the form _wx_h (or _wx_hcm), where _w is the width
          in inches (or cm) and _h is the height in inches (or
          cm), respectively.  There are also synonyms which may
          be used:  us (8.5x11), usr (11x8.5), legal (8.5x14),
          foolscap (13.5x17), as well as the ISO sizes a1-a7,
          b1-b7, c1-c7, a1r-a7r (a1-a7 rotated), etc.  The de-
          fault size is 8.5 x 11 inches.

     --mmggss[[nn]] _s_i_z_e
          (.magnifierSize[n]) Specifies the size of the window to
          be used for the ``magnifying glass'' for Button _n.  See
          the MOUSE ACTIONS section.  Defaults are 200, 350, 600,
          900, and 1200.

     --mmggss _s_i_z_e
          Same as --mmggss11, above.

     --ggeeoommeettrryy _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
          (*geometry) Specifies the initial geometry of the win-
          dow.

     ##_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
          (.iconGeometry) Specifies the initial position for the
          icon.

     --ddiissppllaayy _h_o_s_t:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y
          Specifies the host and screen to be used for displaying
          the dvi file.  This is normally obtained from the en-
          vironment variable ``DISPLAY.''

KKEEYYSSTTRROOKKEESS
     XXddvvii recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its
     window.  Each may optionally be preceded by a (positive or
     negative) number, whose interpretation will depend on the
     particular keystroke.

     qq    Quits the program.  Control-C and control-D will do
          this, too.

     nn    Moves to the next page (or to the nnth next page if a
          number is given).  Synonyms are `ff', Space, Return, and
          Line Feed.

     pp    Moves to the previous page (or back nn pages).  Synonyms
          are `bb', control-H, and Delete.

     gg    Moves to the page with the given number.  Initially,
          the first page is assumed to be page number 1, but this
          can be changed with the `PP' keystroke, below.  If no
          page number is given, then it goes to the last page.

     PP    ``This is page number nn.''  This can be used to make
          the `gg' keystroke refer to actual page numbers instead
          of absolute page numbers.

     CCoonnttrrooll--LL
          Redisplays the current page.

     ^^    Move to the ``home'' position of the page.  This is
          normally the upper left-hand corner of the page,
          depending on the margins as described in the -margins
          option, above.

     uu    Moves up a window-full.

     dd    Moves down a window-full.

     ll    Moves left a window-full.

XDVI                 UNKNOWN MANUAL SECTION                  XDVI



     rr    Moves right a window-full.

     cc    Moves the page so that the point currently beneath the
          cursor is moved to the middle of the window.  It also
          (gasp!) warps the cursor to the same place.

     MM    Sets the margins so that the point currently under the
          cursor is the upper left-hand corner of the text in the
          page.

     ss    Changes the shrink factor to the given number.  If no
          number is given, the smallest factor that makes the en-
          tire page fit in the window will be used.  (Margins are
          ignored in this computation.)

     SS    Sets the density factor to be used when shrinking bit-
          maps.  This should be a number between 0 and 100;
          higher numbers produce lighter characters.

     RR    Forces the dvi file to be reread.  This allows you to
          preview many versions of the same file while running
          _x_d_v_i only once.

     kk    Normally when _x_d_v_i switches pages it moves to the home
          position as well.  The `k' keystroke toggles a `keep-
          position' flag which, when set, will keep the same po-
          sition when moving between pages.  Also `0k' and `1k'
          clear and set this flag, respectively.

MMOOUUSSEE AACCTTIIOONNSS
     If the shrink factor is set to any number other than one,
     then clicking any mouse button will pop up a ``magnifying
     glass'' which shows the unshrunk image in the vicinity of
     the mouse click.  This subwindow disappears when the mouse
     button is released.  Different mouse buttons produce dif-
     ferent sized windows, as indicated by the --mmggss option,
     above.  Moving the cursor while holding the button down will
     move the magnifying glass.

     Also, the scrollbars (if present) behave in the standard
     way:  pushing Button 2 in a scrollbar moves the top or left
     edge of the scrollbar to that point and optionally drags it;
     pushing Button 1 moves the image up or right by an amount
     equal to the distance from the button press to the upper
     left-hand corner of the window; pushing Button 3 moves the
     image down or left by the same amount.

     path(s) searched for fonts in the following manner.  The
     string consists of one or more strings separated by colons.
     In each such string, the substring ``%f'' is changed to the
     font name; ``%d'' is changed to the magnification; and
     ``%p'' is changed to the font family (``gf'', ``pk'', or
     ``pxl'').  If no ``%f'' appears in the string, then the
     string ``/%f.%d%p'' is added on the end.  For example, if
     the string is ``/usr/local/tex/fonts'' and the font is cmr10
     at 300dpi, then it searches for
     /usr/local/tex/fonts/cmr10.300gf,
     /usr/local/tex/fonts/cmr10.300pk, and
     /usr/local/tex/fonts/cmr10.1500pxl, in that order.  If the
     first character of the ``XDVIFONTS'' variable is a colon,
     then the system default paths are tried first.  If the font
     is not found in the desired size, then _x_d_v_i will try to find
     the nearest size.  If the font cannot be found at all, then
     _x_d_v_i will try to vary the point size of the font (within a
     certain range), and if this fails, then it will use the font
     specified as the alternate font (cf. --aallttffoonntt).

     The ``XDVISIZES'' variable must be set to indicate which
     sizes of fonts are available.  It should consists of a list
     of numbers separated by colons.  If the list begins with a
     colon, the system default sizes are used, as well.  Sizes
     are expressed in dots per inch; decimals may be used for
     ``pxl'' files: for example, a 300 dots per inch file magni-
     fied by half a step comes out to 1643 dots per five inches,
     which should be encoded as 328.6.  The current default set
     of sizes is 300:328.6:360:432:518.4:622:746.4.
