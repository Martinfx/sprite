     _D_i_t_r_o_f_f formats text in the named _f_i_l_e_s for printing on the
     printer selected.  Different output devices may be selected
     with the environment variables TYPESETTER and PRINTER or
     with the -P option.  Output will be processed as specified
     in the _d_i_t_c_a_p file, for the particular printer selected.
     The companion preprocessors, pic, ideal, deqn, tbl and grn
     all accept the TYPESETTER and PRINTER environment variables,
     have the -P option, and access the ditcap file.   _T_r_o_f_f''ss
     capabilities are described in the _N_r_o_f_f/_T_r_o_f_f _u_s_e_r'_s _m_a_n_u_a_l.

     It is a good idea to specify a printer using one of the
     environment variables (PRINTER or TYPESETTER), or by using
     the --PP_p_r_i_n_t_e_r option for ditroff and each of its preproces-
     sors.  This is advisable since each preprocessor selects a
     different default device if none is specified.  The device
     independent troff (troff_p) and its associated preprocessors
     (eqn, grn, tbl, ideal, pic,  ...) access the environment
     variables (TYPESETTER and PRINTER), support the --PP_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
     option, and access the _d_i_t_c_a_p file when processing troff
     files.

     If no _f_i_l_e argument is present, the standard input is read.
     An argument consisting of a single minus (--) is taken to be
     a file name corresponding to the standard input.  The
     options are:

     Troff options:

     --PP_d_e_v   Prepare output for typesetter _d_e_v.  If no printer is
             specified, the default is the Laser Writer (lw).
             The environment variable PRINTER will override the
             default, and the environment variable TYPESETTER
             overrides PRINTER.  A -P option will override all
             else.  The _d_i_t_c_a_p file is searched for this printer,
             and the printer type and other options are set from
             this file.

     --TT_t_y_p   Change the printer type to _t_y_p , and don't read the
             printer type from the ditcap file.

     --FF_d_i_r   Use font directory _d_i_r instead of
             /sprite/lib/ditroff.  This overrides the (fd)
             characteristic if it is set in the _d_i_t_c_a_p file.

     --DD_e_n_t   Use the ditcap entry for _e_n_t , rather than the

             ditcap entry for _d_e_v . Thus the ditcap characteris-
             tics are read from the ditcap entry _e_n_t , and the
             output is sent to _d_e_v .

     --tt      Send the troff_p output to standard output.  If the
             (ft) characteristic is set in the ditcap file, then
             pass the output through this filter before sending
             it to standard output.

     --aa      Send a printable ASCII approximation of the results
             to the standard output.  If the (fa) characteristic
             is set in the ditcap file, then pass the output
             through this filter before sending it to standard
             output.

     --oo_l_i_s_t  Print only pages whose page numbers appear in the
             comma-separated _l_i_s_t of numbers and ranges.  A range
             _N--_M means pages _N through _M; an initial -_N means
             from the beginning to page _N; and a final _N- means
             from _N to the end.

     --nn_N     Number first generated page _N.

     --mm_n_a_m_e  Prepend the macro file //sspprriittee//lliibb//ddiittrrooffff//ttmmaacc.._n_a_m_e
             to the input _f_i_l_e_s.

     --rr_a_N    Set register _a (one-character) to _N.

     --ii      Read standard input after the input files are
             exhausted.

     --qq      Disable echoing during a ..rrdd request.

     --ddeebbuugg  Print the lines that ditroff would run, rather than
             making system calls.

     Preprocessing options:

     --ttbbll   Pipe through tbl.

     --eeqqnn   Pipe through eqn.

     --sseeqqnn  Pipe through eqn using the special characters (in
            /sprite/lib/ditroff/eqnxxxxx).

     --ggrrnn   Pipe through grn.

     --ppiicc   Pipe through pic.

     --rreeffeerr Pipe through refer.

     --iiddeeaall Pipe through ideal.

     --hh     Don't print the burst page.

     --mm     Send mail upon completion of the printing job.

     --CC_n_a_m_e Set the classname on the burst page to _n_a_m_e .

     --JJ_n_a_m_e Set the jobname on the burst page to _n_a_m_e .

     --##_N    Print _N copies of the job.

     Some options of _t_r_o_f_f only apply if you have a C/A/T
     typesetter attached to your system.  These options are here
     for historical reasons:

     --ss_N  Stop every _N pages.  _t_r_o_f_f stops the phototypesetter
          every _N pages, produces a trailer to allow changing
          cassettes, and resumes when the typesetter's start but-
          ton is pressed.

     --ff   Refrain from feeding out paper and stopping photo-
          typesetter at the end of the run.

     --ww   Wait until phototypesetter is available, if currently
          busy.

     --bb   Report whether the phototypesetter is busy or avail-
          able.  No text processing is done.

     --ppN  Print all characters in point size _N while retaining
          all prescribed spacings and motions, to reduce photo-
          typesetter elapsed time.

     The following details are only important to the user who
     wants to set the environment variable DITCAP and change
     ditcap entries.
     The details of how files are processed is as follows:
     ( (xx) indicates ditcap characteristics and [ ] indicates
     optional parts )

     First all files are run through the preprocessors specified.
     (we show all preprocessors, but only a few would be used
     together) The first processor receives all the files as
     input - note that this could be troff_p.  This part of the
     command line is assembled as follows.

       PRE = refer SFILES | tbl | grn TYFT | \
             pic TYFT | ideal TYFT | eqn TYFT |

           Where SFILES = "[(se)] files" the (se) string being

           (se) characteristic is specified in the ditcap file.
           And TYFT = " -T _t_y_p [-F _d_i_r ] " _t_y_p is either speci-
           fied in the ditcap file (ty), or using the --TT option;
           _d_i_r is used if it is specified by the -_F option or if
           the (fd) characteristic is specified in the ditcap
           file.

     NOTE:  The preprocessors above and troff_p below would be
            the default ones given in the ditcap(5) documenta-
            tion, unless appropriate ditcap characteristic are
            specified in the ditcap file.
