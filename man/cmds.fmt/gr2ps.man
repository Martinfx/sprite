     This program takes a picture description produced by the
     Gremlin picture editor and converts it a PostScript page
     that can be printed on any printer that supports this
     language, such as the Apple LaserWriter.  _G_r_2_p_s handles the
     different types of elements in this Gremlin output to pro-
     duces a good looking page on a LaserWriter.

     It takes the name of a Gremlin file (default is standard
     input) and writes the resulting PostScript file to its stan-
     dard output, unless the -o option (see below) is given, in
     which case it writes to the specified file.

     _G_r_2_p_s produces a file that can be included into another page
     description.  This is meant to be used when a PostScript
     file is being imbedded into a document of another type (such
     as TeX, using \special).  If the file is to be printed
     directly, the user must add a call to sshhoowwppaaggee to the
     ``%%Trailer'' section at the end.

     The gremlin coordinates are normally coppied out directly to
     PostScript coordinates (the inherited user space).  This
     behavior can be modified with the -s and -t options (see
     below).  Note that if scaling and translation are both
     specified, the translation is performed _a_f_t_e_r the scaling
     (i.e., the translation factor is not affected by the scale).
     This is unlike PostScript, where the order of the operations
     matters.  Also, the lower-left corner of the picture may be
     placed at any location on the page with the -p option.

     By default, the four troff fonts, R, I, B and S are mapped
     to the LaserWriter fonts TTiimmeess--RRoommaann, TTiimmeess--IIttaalliicc, TTiimmeess--
     BBoolldd and CCoouurriieerr--BBoolldd respectively.  This action can be
     changed with the -R, -I, -B and -S options.

     _G_r_2_p_s obeys of the Adobe PostScript file structuring conven-
     tions.  In particular, each file begins with a set of com-
     ments which introduce the file as PostScript code and
     specify the bounding box of the figure along with other
     information.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     -R   set the ``roman'' font to the given LaserWriter font
          (default TTiimmeess--RRoommaann).

     -I   set the ``italic'' font to the given LaserWriter font

          (default TTiimmeess--IIttaalliicc).

     -B   set the ``bold'' font to the given LaserWriter font
          (default TTiimmeess--BBoolldd).

     -S   set the ``special'' font to the given LaserWriter font
          (default CCoouurriieerr--BBoolldd).

     -n   force interpretation of the gremlin file in newer for-
          mat (that produced by the Sun version) rather than the
          older Gremlin format.  If the gremlin file was produced
          by the Sun gremlin, this newer format is automatically
          assumed.

     -o   write output to a certain file rather than the standard
          output.  The -o option must take as an argument the
          name of a file which it can create.

     -p   place the lower-left point of the figure at the coordi-
          nate given by the two floating-point option arguments.
          For example, ``-p 0 0'' can be used to place the figure
          at the origin no matter where Gremlin put it.  Note
          that this is a translation, so only one of -t and -p
          may be specified.

     -s   scale every coordinate by the scale factor given by the
          two floating-point numbers which are the option argu-
          ments.  This has the effect of scaling the resulting
          picture.  Using ``-s 0.75 1.0'' would scale to 75% in
          the X direction and leave the Y direction scale as it
          was, producing a narrower picture.

     -t   translate every coordinate by the two floating-point
          numbers which are the option arguments.  Note: in
          PostScript the point 0, 0 is at the left bottom corner
          of the page, even though the laser writer can't actu-
          ally paint at this point.  Using ``-t 10.0 10.0'' would
          move the figure ten units up and to the right on the
          page.  The translation is applied the coordinates have
          been scaled.

BBUUGGSS
     Because the Gremlin coordinate system is different from the
     PostScript one, the -s and -t options are almost always
     necessary to get the output sized and placed properly.  Of
     course, they can be emulated in PostScript with the ssccaallee
     and ttrraannssllaattee operators.

     The grey scale used does not really correspond in any
     rational way with the set of gremlin stipples.  It would be
     possible to use bit rasters in PostScript to emulate the
     gremlin stipple patterns, but the author thought this of
     dubious use.
