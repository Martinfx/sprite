     The _x_g_r_a_p_h program draws a graph on an X display given data
     read from either data files or from standard input if no
     files are specified.  It can display up to 64 independent
     data sets using different colors and/or line styles for each
     set.  It annotates the graph with a title,  axis labels,
     grid lines or tick marks, grid labels, and a legend.  There
     are options to control the appearance of most components of
     the graph.

     The input format is similar to _g_r_a_p_h(_1_G) but differs
     slightly.  The data consists of a number of _d_a_t_a _s_e_t_s. Data
     sets are separated by a blank line.  A new data set is also
     assumed at the start of each input file.  A data set con-
     sists of an ordered list of points of the form "X Y".  Each
     point must appear on a separate line. The name of a data set
     can be specified by a line which begins with a double quote
     followed by the set name.  An example input file with three
     data sets is shown below (note set three is not named):

     0.5 7.8
     1.0 6.2
     "set one
     1.5 8.9

     "set two
     -3.4 1.4e-3
     -2.0 1.9e-2
     -0.65 2.2e-4

     2.2 12.8
     2.4 -3.3
     2.6 -32.2
     2.8 -10.3

     After _x_g_r_a_p_h has read the data,  it will create a new window
     to graphically display the data.  The interface used to
     specify the size and location of this window depends on the
     window manager currently in use.  Refer to the reference
     manual of the window manager for details.

     Once the window has been opened,  all of the data sets will
     be displayed graphically (subject to the options explained
     below) with a legend in the upper right corner of the
     screen.  To zoom in on a portion of the graph,  depress a

     mouse button in the window and sweep out a region.  _x_g_r_a_p_h
     will then open a new window looking at just that portion of
     the graph.  _x_g_r_a_p_h also presents two control buttons in the
     upper left corner of each window: _C_l_o_s_e and _H_a_r_d_c_o_p_y. Win-
     dows are closed by depressing a mouse button while the mouse
     cursor is inside the _C_l_o_s_e button.  Typing EOF (control-D)
     in a window also closes that window.  Depressing a mouse
     button while the mouse cursor is in the _H_a_r_c_o_p_y button
     causes a dialog to appear asking about hardcopy (printout)
     options.  These options are described below:

     Output Device
          Specifies the type of the output device (e.g. "HPGL",
          "Postscript", etc).  An output device is chosen by
          depressing the mouse inside its name.  The default
          values of other fields will change when you select a
          different output device.

     Disposition
          Specifies whether the output should go directly to a
          device or to a file.  Again,  the default values of
          other fields will change when you select a different
          disposition.

     File or Device Name
          If the disposition is "To Device",  this field speci-
          fies the device name.  A device name is the same as the
          name given for the -P command of lpr(1).  If the dispo-
          sition is "To File",  this field specifies the name of
          the output file.

     Maximum Dimension
          This specifies the maximum size of the plot on the
          hardcopy device in centimeters.  _x_g_r_a_p_h takes in
          account the aspect ratio of the plot on the screen and
          will scale the plot so that the longer side of the plot
          is no more than the value of this parameter.  If the
          device supports it,  the plot may also be rotated on
          the page based on the value of the maximum dimension.

     Title Font Family
          This field specifies the name of a font to use when
          drawing the graph title.  Suitable defaults are ini-
          tially chosen for any given hardcopy device.  The value
          of this field is hardware specific -- refer to the dev-
          ice reference manual for details.

     Title Font Size
          This field specifies the desired size of the title
          fonts in points (1/72 of an inch). If the device sup-
          ports scalable fonts,  the font will be scaled to this
          size.

XGRAPH                    User Commands                    XGRAPH



     Axis Font Family and Axis Font Size
          These fields are like _T_i_t_l_e _F_o_n_t _F_a_m_i_l_y and _T_i_t_l_e _F_o_n_t
          _S_i_z_e except they specify values for the font _x_g_r_a_p_h
          uses to draw axis labels, and legend descriptions.

     Control Buttons
          After specifing the parameters for the plot,  the "Ok"
          button causes _x_g_r_a_p_h to produce a hardcopy.  Pressing
          the "Cancel" button will abort the hardcopy operation.

     _x_g_r_a_p_h accepts a large number of options most of which can
     be specified either on the command line or in the user's
     ~/.Xdefaults file.  A list of these options is given below.
     The command line option is specified first with its X
     default name (if any) in parenthesis afterward.  The format
     of the option in the X defaults file is "program.option:
     value" where program is the program name (xgraph) and the
     option name is the one specified below.  Note that the value
     of a flag in the X defaults file must be "1".

     --<<ddiiggiitt>> <<nnaammee>>
          These options specify the data set name for the
          corresponding data set.  The digit should be in the
          range '0' to '63'.  This name will be used in the
          legend.

     --bb   Force _x_g_r_a_p_h to output the graph in black and white
          (even if the display is color).  This is useful for
          those using _x_w_d(_1) to produce hardcopies of the graph.

     --bbaarr Specifies that vertical bars should be drawn from the
          data points to a base point which can be specified with
          -brb.  Usually,  the -nl flag is used with this option.
          The point itself is located at the center of the bar.

     --bbbb ((BBoouunnddBBooxx))
          Draw a bounding box around the data region.  This is
          very useful if you prefer to see tick marks rather than
          grid lines (see -tk).

     --bbdd <<ccoolloorr>> ((BBoorrddeerr))
          This specifies the border color of the _x_g_r_a_p_h window.

     --bbgg <<ccoolloorr>> ((BBaacckkggrroouunndd))
          Background color of the _x_g_r_a_p_h window.

     --bbrrbb <<bbaassee>>
          This specifies the base for a bar graph.  By default,
          the base is zero.

     --bbrrww <<wwiiddtthh>>
          This specifies the width of bars in a bar graph.  The

          amount is specified in the user's units.  By default,
          a bar one pixel wide is drawn.

     --bbww <<ssiizzee>> ((BBoorrddeerrSSiizzee))
          Border width (in pixels) of the _x_g_r_a_p_h window.

     --ffgg <<ccoolloorr>> ((FFoorreeggrroouunndd))
          Foreground color.  This color is used to draw all text
          and the normal grid lines in the window.

     --llff <<ffoonnttnnaammee>> ((LLaabbeellFFoonntt))
          Label font.  All axis labels and grid labels are drawn
          using this font.  It must be a fixed-width font.

     --llnnxx Specifies a logarithmic X axis.  Grid labels represent
          powers of ten.

     --llnnyy Specifies a logarithmic Y axis.  Grid labels represent
          powers of ten.

     --llww wwiiddtthh
          Specifies the width of the data lines in pixels.  The
          default is one.

     --llxx <<xxll,,xxhh>>
          This option limits the range of the X axis to the
          specified interval.  This (along with -ly) can be used
          to "zoom in" on a particularly interesting portion of a
          larger graph.

     --llyy <<yyll,,yyhh>>
          This option limits the range of the Y axis to the
          specified interval.

     --mm ((MMaarrkkeerrss))
          Mark each data point with a distinctive marker.  There
          are eight distinctive markers used by xgraph.  These
          markers are assigned uniquely to each different line
          style on black and white machines and varies with each
          color on color machines.

     --MM ((SSttyylleeMMaarrkkeerrss))
          Similar to -m but markers are assigned uniquely to each
          eight consecutive data sets (this corresponds to each
          different line style on color machines).

     --nnll ((NNooLLiinneess))
          Turn off drawing lines.  When used with -m,  this can
          be used to produce scatter plots.  When used with -bar,
          it can be used to produce standard bar graphs.

     --pp ((PPiixxeellMMaarrkkeerrss,, SSmmaallllPPiixxeellss))

XGRAPH                    User Commands                    XGRAPH



          Marks each data point with a small marker (pixel
          sized).  This is usually used with the -nl option for
          scatter plots.

     --PP ((LLaarrggeePPiixxeellss))
          Similar to -p but marks each pixel with a large dot.

     --rrvv ((RReevveerrsseeVViiddeeoo))
          Reverse video.  On black and white displays,  this will
          invert the foreground and background colors.  It does
          nothing on color displays.

     --ss ((SSpplliinnee))
          This option specifies the lines should be drawn as
          spline curves.  Currently,  this is implemented using
          the X spline option which fits only three points at a
          time.  Thus,  the effect is not what you might expect.

     --tt <<ssttrriinngg>>
          Title of the plot.  This string is centered at the top
          of the graph.

     --ttff <<ffoonnttnnaammee>> ((TTiittlleeFFoonntt))
          Title font.  This is the name of the font to use for
          the graph title.  It defaults to 9x15.

     --ttkk ((TTiicckkss))
          This option causes _x_g_r_a_p_h to draw tick marks rather
          than full grid lines.  The -bb option is also useful
          when viewing graphs with tick marks only.

     --xx <<uunniittnnaammee>>
          This is the unit name for the X axis.  Its default is
          "X".

     --yy <<uunniittnnaammee>>
          This is the unit name for the Y axis.  Its default is
          "Y".

     --zzgg <<ccoolloorr>> ((ZZeerrooCCoolloorr))
          This is the color used to draw the zero grid line.

     Some options can only be specified in the X defaults file.
     These options are described below:

     <<ddiiggiitt>>..CCoolloorr
          Specifies the color for a data set.  Eight independent
          colors can be specified.  Thus,  the digit should be
          between '0' and '7'.  If there are more than eight data
          sets,  the colors will repeat but with a new line style
          (see below).

     <<ddiiggiitt>>..SSttyyllee
          Specifies the line style for a data set.  A sixteen-bit
          integer specifies the sixteen-bit pattern used for the
          line style.  Eight independent line styles can be
          specified.  Thus,  the digit should be between '0' and
          '7'.  If there are more than eight data sets,  these
          styles will be reused.  On color workstations,  one
          line style is used for each of eight colors.  Thus,  64
          unique data sets can be displayed.

     GGrriiddSSiizzee
          Width,  in pixels,  of normal grid lines.

     GGrriiddSSttyyllee
          Line style pattern of normal grid lines.
