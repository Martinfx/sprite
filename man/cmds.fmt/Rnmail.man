     Rnmail is a friendly interface for mailing replies to news
     articles.  It will ask several questions, then allow you to
     enter your letter, and then mail it off.  If you type h and
     a carriage return at any point, _R_n_m_a_i_l will tell you what it
     wants to know.

     The -h form is used when invoked from _r_n.  If your editor
     can edit multiple files, and you want the article to which
     you are replying to show up as an alternate file, define the
     environment variable MAILPOSTER as "Rnmail -h %h %A".  You
     can also modify the the MAILHEADER environment variable to
     change the header file that _r_n passes to Rnmail.
