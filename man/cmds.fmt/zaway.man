     _z_a_w_a_y provides a way for you to automatically send replies
     when other people contact you using _z_w_r_i_t_e(_1). _z_a_w_a_y sub-
     scribes itself to class "MESSAGE", instance "*", so that it
     can monitor your incoming messages.  It does not affect the
     operation of any other client receiving messages.  _z_a_w_a_y is
     typically run when you are leaving your terminal or display
     temporarily.  _z_a_w_a_y usually never exits; when you return to
     your terminal you should type the interrupt character (usu-
     ally ^C) in order to make _z_a_w_a_y exit.

     _z_a_w_a_y uses a message file (which defaults to $HOME/.away) to
     describe what reponses should be sent to which senders.  The
     general format of this file is:

          >name
          >name
          message
          >name
          message

     Any number of user names may be specified preceding the mes-
     sage to send to those senders.  If a user name appears more
     than once, the message will be a concatenation of each of
     the appropriate messages.  There are two special names: "*"
     indicates that the following message should be sent to all
     senders and "%" indicates that the following message should
     only be sent if the user name has not matched yet.

     If no file is specified, and no default file can be found,
     the following message is returned:

          I'm sorry, but I am currently away from the terminal
          and am not able to receive your message.

     If a user name does not match any of those listed in the
     file, and no "*" or "%" field is specified, no return mes-
     sage is sent.  All messages are preceded by the line
     "Automated reply:".  To avoid loops, messages are not sent
     in response to messages beginning with "Automated reply:" or
     sent by the same Kerberos principal as the user running
     _z_a_w_a_y.

     >tony
     Hi there guys!  I'm in the other room right now.
     I'll be back in 5 minutes or so.
     >jruser
     Sorry, but I'm gone for the day...
     >%
     Hello...I'm not sure who you are.  I'll be back soon,
     though.
     >*
     This message comes to you compliments of zaway!

     The final "compliments" message will be included in all mes-
     sages, whereas the "I'm not sure" message will only be
     included in messages that are not from "eichin", "tony", or
     "jruser".
