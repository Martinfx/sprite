     --hheellpp          Print a summary of the  command-line  options
                    and exit without performing any logins.

     --ll             Don't record information about the user in  a
                    file of logins.  The default is to record the
                    login and logout in a file of logins used  by
                    programs like ffiinnggeerr.

     --PP _p_o_r_t_N_u_m     Use _p_o_r_t_N_u_m as  the  port  number  associated
                    with   this  login  in  the  file  of  logins
                    (ignored if the --ll option is given).

     --rr             Repeat:  when a login shell exits, prompt for
                    another   account  and  password,  and  start
                    another login  shell.   The  default  is  for
                    llooggiinn  to  exit  as  soon  as its login shell
                    exits.

     --dd _d_e_v_i_c_e      Use _d_e_v_i_c_e for  the  login  rather  than  the
                    current tty.

     If an extra argument is given, llooggiinn uses that name  as  the
     name  of  the  user to log in.  Otherwise, it prompts for an
     account name.  In either case, llooggiinn prompts for a password.
     If  the  password matches the account, the user is logged in
     and a command shell is run for the user.  Information  about
     the  account,  password,  home directory, and login shell is
     taken from //eettcc//ppaasssswwdd.  If the password does not match  the
     account, or the account doesn't exist, llooggiinn will prompt for
     a new account and password.

     If _d_e_v_i_c_e is given, then llooggiinn attempts to use  it  for  the
     standard input, standard output, and standard error channels
     associated with the login.  If  no  _d_e_v_i_c_e  is  given,  then
     llooggiinn  uses  the standard I/O channels provided to it by the
     shell.

     Normally, llooggiinn waits for the login  shell  to  exit,  which
     signals  the end of the login session, and then llooggiinn exits.
     If, however, the --rr switch is given, then llooggiinn will  repeat
     itself, asking for another account and password, and running

     another login shell.  This will repeat indefinitely.  If the
     repeat  switch  is  not given, logins will time out after 60
     seconds if they are not completed.

     If the --ll switch isn't given, then llooggiinn will record  infor-
     mation  about the login and logout in a file for use by pro-
     grams like Finger.  The --PP switch is used to indicate  which
     of  several  ports  to  associate  with the login.  If --ll is
     given, then no login information is recorded.
