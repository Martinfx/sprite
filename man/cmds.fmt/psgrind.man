     psgrind - convert C source files to POSTSCRIPT format for

     _p_s_g_r_i_n_d reads in C source files, converts them to POSTSCRIPT
     format, and spools them for printing on a POSTSCRIPT
     printer.  The different fonts used for the different syntac-
     tic elements of C source code may be specified on the com-
     mand line.  _P_s_g_r_i_n_d is also much faster than any other grind
     program since it outputs a direct printer language without
     going through a normal document formatter as other pretty
     source printers must.

     The five syntactic categories that _p_s_g_r_i_n_d recognizes and
     displays in different ways are page headings (which are
     actually not part of the C source code), the ``body'' or
     main text, keywords, which are C reserved words, literal
     strings and comments.  Normally, the heading and keywords
     are set in a bold Helvetica font, the comments in a slanted
     Helvetica font, the body in a normal Helvetica font and
     literal strings and character constants in Courier font.

     All the above fonts may be changed, see the --HH, --BB, --KK, --LL
     and --CC options.  All these options take as their argument a
     font specfication.  These font specifications have two
     parts: A font name as known to POSTSCRIPT (e.g., Times-
     Roman, Times-BoldItalic, Helvetica, Courier), and a point
     size (1 point = 1/72 inch-8 point is a good small font).  So
     ``Courier-Bold8'' is 8 point Courier Bold, ``Helvetica12''
     is 12 point Helvetica.

     The environment variable PSGRIND may be used to specify
     defaults.  The value of PSGRIND is parsed as a string of
     arguments _b_e_f_o_r_e the arguments that appear on the command
     line.  For example setting the environment variable PSGRIND
     to the string ``-B Times-Roman12'' sets your default body
     font to 12 point Times Roman.

     The possible options are:

     --22   Sets two column mode.

     --11   Force one column mode.

     --gg   Causes the fact that a file is garbage to be ignored.
          Normally, any file with more than a small number of
          non-printing characters is suspected of being garbage,
          and not printed-this option means ``print it anyway.''

     --oo   If _p_s_g_r_i_n_d cannot find characters in a font, the miss-
          ing characters are listed.

     --pp _f_i_l_e
          Causes the POSTSCRIPT file to be written to the named
          file rather than being spooled for printing.  As a spe-
          cial case, --pp -- will send the POSTSCRIPT to the stan-
          dard output.

     --rr   Causes the output to be rotated 90 degrees on the page
          (landscape mode).  This is good for output that
          requires a wide page or for program listings when used
          in conjunction with two column mode.  ``psgrind -2r
          _f_i_l_e_s'' is a nice way to get program listings.

     --RR   Force portrait (non-rotated) mode.

     --kk   Enable page prefeed (if the printer supports it).  This
          allows simple documents (e.g., program listings in one
          font) to print somewhat faster by keeping the printer
          running between pages.

     --ss _p_a_g_e_s_p_e_c
          Allows you to specify a range (or several ranges) of
          pages to be printed.  _P_a_g_e_s_p_e_c is a string, not con-
          taining spaces, of the form ``pagerange[,pagespec]''.
          _P_a_g_e_r_a_n_g_e may be a single page number or a range of the
          form ``N-M'' which means print pages N through M.  -N
          means print from the beginning of the docment to page
          N. M- means print from page M to the end of the docu-
          ment.

     --HH _f_o_n_t
          This allows the respecification of the font used to
          print running titles listing the source file name and
          current page number.  The option argument to --HH, and
          the other font options, should be a font specification
          as described above.

     --BB _f_o_n_t
          This allows one to respecify the font to be used for
          the main body of the source, that not set specially in
          another font.

     --KK _f_o_n_t
          This option allows the respecification of the font used
          to show keywords as separate from normal body text.

     --LL _f_o_n_t
          This option allows the respecification of the font used
          to show string and character constants (literals)
          separate from normal body text.

     --CC _f_o_n_t
          This option respecifies the font used to print comment
          text to show its separateness from normal text.

     The following options are passed on as is to _l_p_r.

     --PP_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
          Causes the output to be sent to the named printer.

     --##_n  Causes n copies of the output to be produced.  The
          default is one.

     --mm   Causes the printer daemon to send mail upon job comple-
          tion.

     --hh   Suppress the printing of the burst page.

     --JJ _n_a_m_e
          Set the job name for use on the burst page.  Otherwise,
          the name of the first input file will be used.

          string of options to be used by _p_s_g_r_i_n_d.

     METRICS
          path name of a directory to use instead of /usr/lib/ps
          for font metric files.

     PRINTER
          the name of a printer (as in the --PP option) for _l_p_r to
          use.  If no --PP option is specified, _l_p_r will use this
          printer.  If --PP is not specified and PRINTER is not
          defined in the environment, _p_s_g_r_i_n_d will spool to a
          printer named ``PostScript''.

FFIILLEESS
     /usr/local/lib/ps/*.afm

     If you give the --pp argument after the file to be converted,
     _p_s_g_r_i_n_d will lie and tell you that the file has been put in
     the right place, when in fact it is in some obscure tem-
     porary file.  Always give the --pp argument first.

     Long lines are not truncated in 2 column mode.  Line trunca-
     tion may be off by a little bit as printer margins vary.
     There should be a ``wrap'' option and multiple (truncated or
     wrapped) columns.

     _P_s_g_r_i_n_d generates temporary files which are spooled for
     printing.  The temporary file names are used by the spooling
     software (e.g., _l_p_q), rather than the symbolic job name
     passed to _l_p_r.
