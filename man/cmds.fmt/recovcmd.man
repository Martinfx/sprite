     This command changes variables affecting the behavior of  he
     recovery  system.   The only variable so far is the absolute
     pinging variable.  If it's turned on, this means that  ping-
     ing  of  servers occurs at absolute intervals, unaffected by
     how long the actual pinging takes.  If turned off, then  the
     pinging  takes  place 30 seconds after the last pinging fin-
     ished, no matter how long that took.   Turning  on  absolute
     pinging  should  prevent  client  pinging from becoming syn-
     chronized by server reboots.
