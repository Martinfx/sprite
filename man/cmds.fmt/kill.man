     --gg             Treat each _p_i_d as the name of a process group
                    rather  than  a  process,  and send the given
                    signal to the entire group.

     --hheellpp          Print a summary of the  command-line  options
                    and exit without sending any signals.

     --ll             Print out a list of valid  signal  names  and
                    exit without sending any signals.

     --_s_i_g_n_a_l        Send _s_i_g_n_a_l to the given  processes.   _S_i_g_n_a_l
                    may  be  either  a number or a symbolic name.
                    The legal names are the  same  as  the  names
                    from  the  <signal.h>  include  file,  except
                    without the ``SIG'' prefix.  _S_i_g_n_a_l  defaults
                    to TTEERRMM.

     This command sends a signal (usually a SIGTERM kill  signal)
     to  one  or  more processes.  Depending on how the processes
     have arranged for the signal to be  handled,  the  processes
     may  exit, enter the debugger, ignore the signal altogether,
     or execute a handler procedure within the process.   In  the
     default  case  where  the SIGTERM signal is used, the normal
     result is for the process to exit.  See  the  ssiiggvveecc  manual
     page for more details on signal handling.

     Note:  The C-shell (csh) contains a  built-in  command  kkiillll
     that  behaves almost identically to this command (it doesn't
     support the --gg or --hheellpp options, but is otherwise the same).
     If  you  are running the C-shell and type kkiillll, you will get
     the built-in command:  to get the  program  version,  invoke
     kkiillll by typing its absolute path name.
