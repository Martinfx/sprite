     The argument --PP_x_x_x loads parameters and character defini-
     tions for typesetter _x_x_x, which at the moment is typically
     one of _p_s_c (PostScript), _i_p (imagen), _v_a (varian), _v_p (ver-
     satec) or _t_e_r (terminal or printer).

     --FF_y_y_y causes font information to be loaded from directory
     _y_y_y instead of the default //sspprriittee//lliibb//ddiittrrooffff//ddeevv_x_x_x.

     The most significant new facility is the ability to draw
     simple graphical objects - diagonal lines, circles,
     ellipses, arcs, splines, and filled polygons - in TROFF .

     The new graphical commands are

     \D'l _d_h _d_v'
               draw line from current position by _d_h, _d_v
     \D'c _d'
               draw circle of diameter _d with left side at current position
     \D'e _d_1 _d_2'
               draw ellipse of diameters _d_1 _d_2
     \D'a _d_h_1 _d_v_1 _d_h_2 _d_v_2'
               draw arc counter-clockwise from current position to _d_h_1+_d_h_2
               _d_v_1+_d_v_2, with center at _d_h_1 _d_v_1 from current position
     \D'~ _d_h_1 _d_v_1 _d_h_2 _d_v_2 ...'
               draw B-spline from current position by _d_h_1 _d_v_1
               then by _d_h_2, _d_v_2, then by _d_h_3, _d_v_3, then ...
     \D'g _d_h_1 _d_v_1 _d_h_2 _d_v_2 ...'
               same as \D'~ _d_h_1 ...' except the gremlin spline
               algorithm is used.
     \D'p _n _d_h_1 _d_v_1 _d_h_2 _d_v_2 ...'
               draw polygon using stipple _n from current stipple font
               starting at current position by _d_h_1 _d_v_1 then by _d_h_2, _d_v_2,
               then by _d_h_3, _d_v_3, then ...
     \D'P _n _d_h_1 _d_v_1 _d_h_2 _d_v_2 ...'
               same as \D'p _n _d_h_1 ...' except no border is printed.
     \D't _d'
               set line thickness to _d (set to 3 units at startup).
               The default units are ems, so _d must be given in _u
               units if a number of pixels is needed.
     \D's _d'
               set line style to _d (set to -1 at startup).  The value is
               taken as a coordinate mask on the individual bits of the line.
               The default units are ems, so _d must be given in _u units.

     The position after a graphical object has been drawn is at
     its ``end'', where for circles and ellipses, the end is at
     the right side.  As with other commands, default units are
     ems horizontally and line spaces vertically.

     Realistically, these commands are not intended for direct

     use, but for preprocessors like PIC, IDEAL, and GRN.

     ..ssyy _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_l_i_n_e executes the command, then returns.  Output
     is not captured anyplace.

     ..ccff _f_i_l_e copies _f_i_l_e into the TROFF output file at this
     point, uninterpreted.  Havoc ensues unless the motions in
     the file restore current horizontal and vertical position.
     This command hasn't been used much, and is probably a bad
     idea anyway.

     ..ppii _p_r_o_g_r_a_m (pipe the output into _p_r_o_g_r_a_m) now works in
     TROFF as well as NROFF, since it makes somewhat more sense
     to allow it.

     ..sstt _s_t_i_p_p_l_e__f_o_n_t loads _s_t_i_p_p_l_e__f_o_n_t as the current font used
     to fill polygons, with each polygon command selecting one
     pattern number from the font.  The available stipple fonts
     are listed in the "font" manual page.

     The number register $$$$ contains the process id of the TROFF
     process.

     The string ..TT contains the name of the current typesetter
     (e.g., _p_s_c, _v_a, _v_p, _i_p).

     The ..fftt command causes the named font to be loaded on font
     position 0 (which is in all other ways inaccessible) if the
     font exists and is not currently mounted by default or by a
     ..ffpp command.  The font must be still or again in position 0
     when the line is printed.

     Transparent mode (\!) has been fixed so that transparent
     output actually appears in the output; thus special commands
     can be passed through to postprocessors by witchcraft like

     .if "\*(.T"psc" \!x ...

     (If this makes no sense to you, you shouldn't be using it
     anyway.)

     The ..ffzz and ..llii commands are no more.  The --pp, --gg and ++nn
     command line arguments have also been eliminated, as has the
     hhpp number register.
