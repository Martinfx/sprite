     _B_a_r_g is used to generate bar graphs in gremlin format.  It
     takes up to two arguments.  The first argument is the name
     of the _b_a_r_g input file.  The second argument is the name of
     the gremlin file to store the output of _b_a_r_g into.  If the
     output file is not specified then output goes to standard
     output.  If the input file is also missing then input is
     read from standard input.

     A _b_a_r_g input file is an ASCII file containing _b_a_r_g commands
     and data.  Each command is on a separate line.  White space
     can be used to separate the different arguments to each com-
     mand. Lines beginning with a "#" and blank lines are
     ignored.  All command arguments that affect the dimensions
     of the graph are specified in pixels.

     Graphs are divided up into sets of bars.  Each set can con-
     tain from 1 to 8 bars and there can be any number of sets.
     The program is fully parameterized such that the bar width,
     inner bar spacing, inner set spacing, graph height and graph
     width can all be specified.  All parameters that are not
     specified, except for the number of sets and the number of
     bars in each set which must be specified, will either
     default to preset values or be calculated.  If the inner set
     spacing is not specified or it is specified as -1, it will
     be calculated from the bar width, inner bar spacing and
     graph width.  Likewise if the inner set spacing is set but
     the bar width is not then it will be calculated from the
     other parameters.

     The following is a summary of the _b_a_r_g commands:

     7         <bar type> <bar label>
     8         <bar type> <bar label>

     The following explains each command in more detail:

     b    Define the left and right border in pixels.  The left
          border width is the number of pixels between the y-axis
          and the first bar graph.  The right border width is the
          number of pixels that the x-axis extends past the last
          bar graph.

     d    Define a bar graph set.  These commands should be the
          last commands in the input file.  The label is the
          string to draw at the bottom of the bar graph set.  The
          following lines up until a line beginning with an "e"
          is found are taken as floating point y values for bars
          in the bar graph set. The line with the "e" marks the
          end of the bar graph set.  There cannot be more than
          the number of bars per set lines of data between the
          "d" and "e" commands.

     h    The graph height in pixels.

     k    Bar graph key information.  At the bottom of each graph
          each of the different bar types is drawn along with the
          associated label (see the 1-8 commands below).  The
          left key border specifies the number of pixels between
          the y-axis and the first key.  The right key border is
          the number of pixels between the end of the x-axis and
          the rightmost key.  The key width and height define the
          size of the bar that is drawn that represents the key.

     lx   Label to print on the x-axis.

     ly   Label to print on the y-axis.

     n    Define the number of bar sets and the number of bars in
          each set.  This command must come after the dimensions
          of the graph are defined and before the data sets are
          defined with the "d" command.

     p    Print a percent sign after each value on the y-axis.

     s    Define the number of pixels between each bar and
          between each set of bars.

     t    Title the graph.

     w    The width of the graph in pixels.

     y    Define the range of the y-axis.  The # of ticks is the
          number of pieces to divide the y-axis into, the delta
          is the size of each piece and the starting value is the
          base value for y.

     W    The width of each bar.

     [1-8]
          Define the type of the ith bar in a set.  The type must
          be between 0 and 7 and corresponds to the 8 gremlin
          filled polygon types.  The label is used to print out
          the bar type key.
