                    and enter the debugger.

     --rr             Cause _m_a_c_h_i_n_e to reboot,  using  the  default
                    boot  source.   _M_a_c_h_i_n_e  must currently be in

                    boot  source.   _M_a_c_h_i_n_e  must currently be in

     The kkmmssgg command is used to assist in debugging and  reboot-
     ing remote Sprite kernels.  _M_a_c_h_i_n_e is the name of a machine
     running Sprite, and _o_p_t_i_o_n specifies what sort of  operation
     to  perform  on that machine.  KKmmssgg will open a special net-
     work port to the specified kernel and send  it  messages  to
     carry out the specified operation.


BBUUGGSS
     The type (or at least byte-order?)  of  the  target  machine
     must match that of the machine that kkmmssgg is run on.
