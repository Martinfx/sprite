     _g_d_b is a source level symbolic debugger for C programs,
     created by Richard M. Stallman (rms) for the GNU Project,
     and distributed by the Free Software Foundation.  Eventually
     GNU (Gnu's Not Unix) will be a complete replacement for
     Berkeley Unix, all of which everyone will be able to use
     freely.  See the _G_N_U _E_m_a_c_s man page for pointers to more
     information.

     _g_d_b has something of the flavor of _d_b_x, but has more
     features and power.  It can also be used to debug o/s ker-
     nels, but needs to be configured differently for that task.

     Project GNU isn't using Unix man pages.  Its style of com-
     plete documentation can be found by:

     The help and info commands inside _g_d_b.

     In the Info system in _G_N_U _E_m_a_c_s.  Type C-h i, and follow the
     directions.  This is equivalent to the reference manual for
     _g_d_b, and has about 55 pages of text.

     _g_d_b could be extended to work with other languages (e.g.
     Pascal) and machines (e.g. encores).  If you like, copy the
     sources and give it a try.  When you have it working send
     _d_i_f_f -_c's of the changed files to bug-gdb@prep.ai.mit.edu
     (fuller details below), so they can benefit everyone.

     _g_d_b is free; anyone may redistribute copies of _g_d_b to anyone
     under the terms stated in the _g_d_b General Public License, a
     copy of which accompanies each copy of _g_d_b, is readable with
     the info command inside _g_d_b, and which also appears in the
     _g_d_b reference manual.

     Copies of _g_d_b may sometimes be received packaged with dis-
     tributions of Unix systems, but it is never included in the
     scope of any license covering those systems.  Such inclusion
     would violate the terms on which distribution is permitted.
     In fact, the primary purpose of the General Public License
     is to prohibit anyone from attaching any other restrictions
     to redistribution of _g_d_b.

     You can order printed copies of the _g_d_b reference manual for
     $10.00/copy postpaid from the Free Software Foundation,
     which develops GNU software (contact them for quantity

     There is a mailing list, bug-gdb@prep.ai.mit.edu on the
     internet (ucbvax!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gdb on UUCPnet), for
     reporting _g_d_b bugs and fixes.  But before reporting some-
     thing as a bug, please try to be sure that it really is a
     bug, not a misunderstanding or a deliberate feature.  We ask
     you to read the section ``Reporting Emacs Bugs'' near the
     end of the _G_N_U _E_m_a_c_s reference manual (or Info system) for
     hints on how and when to report bugs.  Also, include the
     version number of the _g_d_b you are running in _e_v_e_r_y bug
     report that you send in.

     Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report.  The pur-
     pose of reporting bugs is to get them fixed for everyone in
     the next release, if possible.  For personal assistance,
     look in the SERVICE file (see the _G_N_U _E_m_a_c_s man page) for a
     list of people who offer it.

     Please do not send anything but bug reports to this mailing
     list.  Send other stuff to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu (or the
     corresponding UUCP address).  For more information about GNU
     mailing lists, see the file MAILINGLISTS (see the _G_N_U _E_m_a_c_s
     man page).  Bugs tend actually to be fixed if they can be
     isolated, so it is in your interest to report them in such a
     way that they can be easily reproduced.

     No bugs are known at this time.
