     --ss _s_e_r_v_e_r_I_D   The serverID is needed for devices attached to
                   a  particular host.  If not specified then the
                   device created is a _c_o_m_m_o_n device found on all
                   hosts  and the local instance of the device is
                   used.  The serverID is a numeric hostID, not a
                   name.

     --dd _d_e_v_T_y_p_e    This specifies the type of the  device.   This
                   is     a     numeric     value     found    in
                   /sprite/src/kernel/dev/*.md/devTypesInt.h

     --uu _u_n_i_t       The unit number of the device.

     --pp _m_o_d_e       This specifies the permission bits of the dev-
                   ice file.

     _n_a_m_e          This is the name of the device.

     Fsmakedev creates a special device file  that  is  a  place-
     holder  for  a peripheral device.  The device file indicates
     the device type and a unit number.  It  also  indicates  the
     location  of  the device.  In Sprite devices are either _c_o_m_-
     _m_o_n, which means that all  hosts  have  them,  or  they  are
     specific  to  a  particular  host.   When a common device is
     opened then the device attached to the local host  is  used.
     Otherwise  the  serverID  in the device file indicates where
     the device is.  The default is for a common device  file  to
     be  created.  Use the --ss option to specific the serverID for
     devices attached to a particular host.  By convention common
     devices  are  found in the /dev directory, and specific dev-
     ices are in the /hosts/_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e/dev directory.

BBUUGGSS
     The  device  type  is  a   magic   number   found   in   the
     /sprite/src/kernel/dev/*.md/devTypesInt.h  file.   The  ser-
     verID is a numeric hostID, not a hostname.
