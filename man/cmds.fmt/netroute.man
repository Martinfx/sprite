     This command is used to access the kernel's  internal  route
     table.   This  route  table  is used to determine routes for
     sending RPC packets between the hosts. The route  table  has
     nothing  to  do  with  user-level  network communication via
     TCP/IP or similar protocols.  Normally nneettrroouuttee  is  invoked
     during  the  boot  script to install routes to all the hosts
     found in /etc/spritehosts (/etc/spritehosts.new  during  the
     transition  period  to the new spritehosts file format). The
     /etc/spritehosts file contains the spriteID of the  host,  a
     network  type  and  address  (i.e.  ethernet),  an  internet
     address, a machine type, and a name plus  optional  aliases.
     The  spriteID  is  used  internally  for  RPC  communication
     between Sprite hosts.  The network type and network  address
     are  used  to map the Sprite ID to the correct local network
     address.  The internet address is used for the internet pro-
     tocols.   The machine type is used when expanding the string
     ``$MACHINE'' inside pathnames.  The file  server  must  know
     its  clients  machine  types  in order to do this correctly.
     The names are used to make console error messages contain  a
     human  understandable  host name, and are also used with the
     internet library routines.

     There are three operations that can be performed on  routes.
     One  is  to  print them, another is to install them, and the
     last is to delete them.  These operations are specified with
     the pp, ii and dd options.


IINNSSTTAALLLLIINNGG RROOUUTTEESS
     For installing hosts, the information is normally taken from
     a  host database file.  A host can be installed from scratch
     by  specifying  its  name  (hhRR  ooppttiioonn)),,  mmaacchhiinnee  ttyyppee  ((mmRR

     strings  passed  to  these  options  must  be  of  the  form
     _n_e_t__a_d_d_r_e_s_s@_i_n_e_t__a_d_d_r_e_s_s because each network interface  has
     both  a  network  address and an internet address.  At least
     one must be specified.

     Routes to hosts can be installed only over one network type.
     When  they  are  installed, nneettrroouuttee uses a list of types to

     check in a predefined order (use the vv option to  find  this
     order.)  It  will  try  to establish a route using the first
     network type; if that fails, it  will  try  the  next,  etc.
     This  list  can  be  changed dynamically using the ffaavvoorr and
     ddiissffaavvoorr options to either favor one network  type  most  or
     one  network type the least, respectively.  Both options can
     be used at the same time.

     For example, normally routes are installed over ethernet. To
     change  it so that fddi routes are installed where possible,
     use:

     % netroute -i -favor fddi

     This will install fddi routes to those machines that support
     fddi routes, and ethernet routes to the remainder.

     When new routes are  installed  successfully,  the  previous
     route is removed.


DDEELLEETTIINNGG RROOUUTTEESS
     Routes are deleted by specifying a  route  ID  using  the  dd
     option.


PPRRIINNTTIINNGG RROOUUTTEESS
     When routes are printed, the following information is  given
     about  each  route:  the  Sprite ID of the host to which the
     route goes; the hostname and the machine type of that  host;
     a  description  of  the route from the kernel; the route ID,
     and the route ID shifted by right by 16 places; the  network
     type  of  the  route;   the network address of the interface
     from which the route sends packets;  the protocol  that  the
     route  serves;  the  route  flags;  a reference count to the
     route; min and max packet sizes over the route; min and  max
     RPC  sizes  over  the  route; and the network address of the
     destination host to which packets are sent.
