     _Z_w_r_i_t_e sends a message from you to another user through the
     _z_e_p_h_y_r(_1) notification service.  The user must have sub-
     scribed to messages of the appropriate class and instance
     using the _z_c_t_l(_1) program.

     _Z_w_r_i_t_e understands the following options.

     --aa          Causes _z_w_r_i_t_e to send the message authenticated,
                 using _K_e_r_b_e_r_o_s to perform the authentication.
                 This is the default.

     --dd          Causes _z_w_r_i_t_e to send the message unauthenti-
                 cated.

     --vv          Causes _z_w_r_i_t_e to print what type of message it
                 is sending, and whether or not it was success-
                 ful.

     --qq          Forces _z_w_r_i_t_e to suppress information about
                 whether or not the message was sent.

     --tt          Prevents _z_w_r_i_t_e from expanding tabs in the mes-
                 sage into appropriate spaces.  Normally _z_w_r_i_t_e
                 will expand any tabs it finds into the appropri-
                 ate number of spaces to maintain separation
                 based on 8-character tab stops.

     --ll          Causes _z_w_r_i_t_e to ignore `.' on a line by itself
                 in the input and only end a typed message when
                 the user types the end-of-file character (usu-
                 ally control-D).  When the input is not a termi-
                 nal, this is the default action.

     --uu          Sends an urgent message.  This changes the
                 _z_e_p_h_y_r instance of the message to ``URGENT''.

     --oo          Causes _z_w_r_i_t_e to ignore the Zephyr variables
                 _z_w_r_i_t_e-_c_l_a_s_s, _z_w_r_i_t_e-_i_n_s_t, and _z_w_r_i_t_e-_o_p_c_o_d_e
                 when picking a default class, instance, and
                 opcode.

     --nn          prevents _z_w_r_i_t_e from sending a PING message to
                 verify the recipient is subscribing to messages.

                 By default, _z_w_r_i_t_e will send a notice to the
                 destination class, instance, and recipient, with
                 opcode ``PING'' before sending the message.  If
                 the PING is sent, and the server response indi-
                 cates there are no recipients subscribed to your
                 message, _z_w_r_i_t_e exits without sending a message.
                 When the --mm option is used, no PING is sent.

     --ss _s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e
                 sets the signature to be included in the mes-
                 sage.  This overrides both the user's name (as
                 found in the password file) and any setting of
                 the Zephyr variable _z_w_r_i_t_e-_s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e.  _s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e
                 must be a single argument, hence when using a
                 shell it should be quoted with double quotes.  A
                 _s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e argument of "" leaves the signature in
                 the message empty.

     --cc _c_l_a_s_s    Allows a user to specify a different class for
                 the message.  This allows a message to be sent
                 to a large group of people with some degree of
                 security.  See _z_e_p_h_y_r(_1) and _z_e_p_h_y_r_d(_8) for a
                 description of how to restrict access to
                 classes.  When this option is specified, the
                 message is sent to recipient "*" unless an addi-
                 tional list of recipients is specified.
                 This argument may not be used in conjunction
                 with the -f option.

     --ii _i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e Allows a user to specify a different instance
                 than the default.  When this option is used, the
                 message is sent to recipient "*" unless an addi-
                 tional list of recipients is specified.  This
                 allows a message to be sent to a large group of
                 people (e.g. a development group) just by having
                 the members subscribe to messages of class "MES-
                 SAGE", the specified instance, and recipient
                 "*".
                 This argument may not be used in conjunction
                 with the -f option.

     --OO _o_p_c_o_d_e   Allows a user to specify a different opcode for
                 the message.  Some Zephyr notice display pro-
                 grams may use the opcode to decide how to
                 display a notice.

     --ff _a_r_g      Allows a user to specify an argument to be
                 interpreted as a filesystem specification.  The
                 class is set to FFIILLSSRRVV.  he instance is set to
                 _a_r_g as modified: If _a_r_g contains no colons
                 (`:'), it is assumed to be a host name, and it
                 is converted into an official host name via

                 _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e(_3). If _a_r_g contains a colon, the
                 portion preceding the colon is treated as a host
                 name, and the colon and any trailing characters
                 are appended to the offical host name returned
                 by _g_e_t_h_o_s_t_b_y_n_a_m_e. If the name fails to resolve
                 into an official host name, the instance is set
                 to _a_r_g unmodified.
                 This option may not be used in conjunction with
                 the -c or -i option.

     --mm          _Z_w_r_i_t_e sends the remaining arguments on the com-
                 mand line as the message.

     If the -_m option is not specified, the user is prompted for
     the message to be sent.  The message may be terminated by
     typing ^D or ``.'' on a line by itself.

     The default class for messages is ``MESSAGE'', the default
     instance is ``PERSONAL'', andthe default opcode is ``'' (an
     empty string).  These defaults can be overridden by setting
     the Zephyr variables _z_w_r_i_t_e-_c_l_a_s_s, _z_w_r_i_t_e-_i_n_s_t, and _z_w_r_i_t_e-
     _o_p_c_o_d_e, respectively.  Command-line options can override the
     defaults.

     If the class is ``MESSAGE'' and the instance is either
     ``PERSONAL'' or ``URGENT'', a recipient must be specified.
     These comparisons are case-sensitive.

     Unless the --ss option is used, the contents of the Zephyr
     variable _z_w_r_i_t_e-_s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e are used to augment the user's
     username in the message.  If _z_w_r_i_t_e-_s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e is not set and
     the --ss option is not specified, the user's full name (as
     specified in the password file) is used instead.

BBUUGGSS
     Tab expansion should really be done by the receiver of the
     message.
     The -u option is provided for compatibility with old ver-
     sions of _z_w_r_i_t_e and is not necessarily useful for sending
     messages to users who do not have old subscription files.
