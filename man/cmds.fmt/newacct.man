     This program prompts the user for the information needed  to
     create  a new user account.  It asks for the login id of the
     new user, the group, office  number,  home  and  work  phone
     number,  and  the project that the account will be used for.
     Once all the information is collected, it is mailed  to  the
     system administer, who will create the account.
