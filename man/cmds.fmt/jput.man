     --aarrcchh _a_r_c_h_i_v_e Name of logical archive.  If  none  is  speci-
                   fied,  the  environment  variable  JARCHIVE is
                   used, if defined, else the default archive  is
                   used.

     --sseerrvveerr _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e
                   Specifies host where Jaquith  server  is  run-
                   ning.  Defaults  to  the  environment variable
                   JSERVER.

     --ppoorrtt _p_o_r_t    Specifies port number where Jaquith server  is
                   running.  Defaults to the environment variable
                   JPORT.

     --mmoodd _d_a_t_e     Dump files modified since specified date.

     --aabbss _t_e_x_t     Put _t_e_x_t in the abstract line for each file.

     --aabbssffiilltteerr _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
                   Invoke _p_r_o_g_r_a_m to generate abstract  for  each
                   file. The utility _f_i_l_e is a good choice.

     --aabbssffiilltteerroopptt _o_p_t_i_o_n_s
                   Option string to be passed to  _a_b_s_f_i_l_t_e_r  pro-
                   gram.  Must  be  enclosed in quotes if it con-
                   tains spaces. ie. "-a -l".

     --lliinnkk         Follow symbolic links. By default, the link is
                   saved, not the file it points to.

     --ssyynncc         Write data  synchronously  to  tape.  Normally
                   data  is  buffered  on disk. There is a severe
                   performance penalty with this option.

     --ffoorrccee        Force files to be archived, even if an  up-to-
                   date copy already exists on the archive.

     --vv            Verbose  mode.  Show  filenames  as  they  are

                   processed.

     --ddiirr          Put the directory and top level contents only.
                   By default jput is recursive.

     --mmaaiill _m_a_i_l_a_d_d_r
                   Send response by mail to _m_a_i_l_a_d_d_r when  opera-
                   tion is complete.

     --nneewwvvooll       Force data  onto  a  new  volume.   The  -sync
                   option is also required.

     --pprruunnee _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
                   Subtrees with simple names  matching  globbing
                   expression  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n  will  not be archived,
                   but their  names  will  still  appear  in  the
                   parent directory list. Default is NULL expres-
                   sion.

     --pprruunneeffuullll _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
                   Subtrees with  absolute  path  names  matching
                   globbing  expression  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n  will  not be
                   archived, but their names will still appear in
                   the  parent  directory  list.  Default is NULL
                   expression.

     --iiggnnoorree _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
                   Files  with  simple  names  matching  globbing
                   expression _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n will not be archived and
                   their names will not be listed in  the  parent
                   directory.  Default is '{#*#,*~}'.

     --ccrroossss        Sprite only: Enable crossing of remote  links.
                   By  default  jput  stays within the filesystem
                   containing the files on the command line.

     --aacckkffrreeqq _c_o_u_n_t
                   Server should acknowledge every _c_o_u_n_t file.

     --llooccaall        Sprite only: The files are local to the server
                   so  don't  send the data over the net. This is
                   strictly a Sprite performance hack  for  large
                   backups. Invoker must be login id 'root'.

     JJppuutt stores a directory subtree onto an archive system  con-
     trolled  by  the  Jaquith server.  The filenames which match
     _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_s are stored on the archive if they have been  modi-
     fied  since  the  last  time  they  were archived, or if the
     --ffoorrccee option is used.

     The argument _f_i_l_e_p_a_t_h is interpreted as it would  be  for  a
     standard ls command, i.e., it is interpreted relative to the
     current working directory, unless it begins with '/'.

     A plain file is considered to be modified if the last modif-
     ication  time/date  as  reported by ssttaatt is more recent than
     the date/time the file was archived, or if  the  permissions
     have  changed.   A  directory  is considered modified if the
     list of files in it has changed since it was last  archived,
     or if the permissions have changed.

     The list of  filenames  is  filtered  (using  Unix  globbing
     rules,  but  see  BUGS below) by the --pprruunnee, --pprruunneeffuullll, and
     --iiggnnoorree expressions. Any filename which matches any of these
     expressions  is  silently  skipped.  The options are similar
     except that pruned filenames will  appear  in  their  parent
     directory's list whereas ignored files will not.

     _d_a_t_e is of the form _D_a_t_e_S_p_e_c[:_T_i_m_e_S_p_e_c]. _T_i_m_e_S_p_e_c is of  the
     form   [hh[:mm[:ss]]],   and   _D_a_t_e_S_p_e_c   is   of  the  form
     dd-month[-yyyy]. Month is the first 3 letters of the  month;
     all  others  are  numbers. The '/' character is a substitute
     for '-' and '.' may be used instead of ':'.

BBUUGGSS
     Files are stored and indexed by their  current  pathname  so
     there is no way to store file _f_o_o as _b_a_r.

     There is currently no support for hard links.

     Unlike the shell, the Jaquith globbing  characters  '*'  and
     '?' match a '.' in the first position.

     An abstract must be less than 16 kilobytes long.
