                    nal emulator for standard input and  standard
                    output.  When the command completes, the win-
                    dow will be destroyed and ttxx will exit.   The
                    default  command  is ``/bin/csh -i'', or if a
                    SHELL environment variable is  defined,  then
                    it is invoked with a -i argument.

IINNTTRROODDUUCCTTIIOONN
     TTxx is a terminal emulator that uses the facilities of the  X
     window  system,  the  Sx  supplementary library, and the Tcl
     command interpreter.   It  executes  a  command  (usually  a
     shell)  and  arranges  for  the command's standard input and
     standard output streams to be  directed  from/to  a  pseudo-
     terminal  controlled by ttxx.  TTxx, in turn, displays a scroll-
     able window in more-or-less the same way as mmxx;  output from
     the  application  is  displayed in the window and keystrokes
     typed in the window are passed through to  the  application.
     TTxx windows emulate a very simple terminal with enough facil-
     ities to run programs like vi.

     The implementation of ttxx is very similar to that of mmxx;   it
     shares  much  of  the  code  and  many of the commands.  You
     should read the mmxx manual page before reading this  one,  in
     order  to learn about the basic command interface and the mmxx
     commands.  TTxx commands that are identical to mmxx commands are
     not  documented  here  except  by reference to the mmxx manual
     page.

..TTXX FFIILLEESS
     After processing command line options and opening  the  win-
     dow,  ttxx  checks for the existence of a file ``.tx'' in your
     home directory (environment variable  HOME).   If  the  file
     exists,  ttxx  reads it in and processes it as a command file,
     just as if it were read with the ssoouurrccee  command.   Then  it
     checks  for  a  .tx  file  in  the  current  directory,  and
     processes it if it exists.


SSEELLEECCTTIIOONN
     Selection in ttxx is identical to that in mmxx, except  for  one
     difference.   In  ttxx  the caret always appears at the end of
     the typescript, except when the typescript  is  in  vi  mode
     (see  the  vvii  command);   there is no way to reposition the
     caret with the mouse.


VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
     See the mmxx manual page for overall information.  The special
     variables defined by ttxx are:

          aarrggss Set by ttxx to hold the  arguments  to  the  current
               variable being executed, if any.

          hheeiigghhtt
               Set by ttxx to hold the height  of  the  window,  in
               lines  of text.  If the last line appearing in the
               window  is  only  partially  visible,  it  doesn't
               count.

          sseeaarrcchhCCmmdd
               When  the  middle  button  is   clicked   in   the
               ``Search''  string  entry, or when carriage-return
               is typed there, the contents of this variable  are
               executed as a command.

          sseeaarrcchhSSttrriinngg
               Set by ttxx to hold the contents of the search entry
               subwindow.

          tteerrmmccaapp
               Set by ttxx to hold a termcap  entry  that  provides
               enough  functionality  to run Vi and other prehis-
               toric screen-based programs.  It's based on a ter-
               minal type ``tx''.  This variable is automatically
               reset whenever the window changes size.

          vveerrssiioonn
               Set by ttxx to hold a version  number  in  the  form  |
               _x._y,  where changes in _x correspond to major revi-  |
               sions with probable incompatibilities, and changes  |

               should not cause substantial  compatibility  prob-  |
               lems.

          wwiiddtthh
               Set by ttxx to hold the  width  of  the  window,  in
               characters.   If  the  last  character position is
               only partially-visible, then it doesn't count.  If
               a  variable-width  font is being used, the average
               character size is used in computing  the  window's
               width.

          wwiinnddoowwIIdd
               Set by ttxx to hold the X window identifier for this
               window.

     TTxx is based around the Tcl interpreter just as mmxx is.   Each
     keystroke  or  menu  selection  is  bound  to  a Tcl command
     string, which is passed to the Tcl  interpreter  for  execu-
     tion.  See the Tcl man page for details on the built-in com-
     mands provided by Tcl.  In addition to them, ttxx provides the
     following  additional  built-in  commands.  Many of them are
     identical to the corresponding commands in mmxx.

          If _o_p_t_i_o_n is oonn, this command enables escape  sequences
          in  window output:  whenever ttxx finds an escape charac-
          ter (338) in the stream of  characters  output  to  the
          pseudo-device  for  display  in the window, it discards
          the escape sequence and interprets the following  char-
          acters (up to and including the next newline character)
          as a ttxx command rather than characters to be  displayed
          in  the window.  If _o_p_t_i_o_n is ooffff, escape sequences are

          mechanisms  to  work.   This  command is most useful to

          emulation to run the vi editor.  When the window is  in
          vi  mode,  an  additional  window-full  of  blank lines
          (called the _v_i _a_r_e_a) is added at the beginning (top) of

          the  typescript,  and  the  view  is shifted to display
          those lines.  Most of the vvii commands are used only  in
          the  crude  termcap  entry that ttxx provides for itself.
          The vvii command must have one of the following forms:

          vvii eenntteerr
               Enter vi mode.  Fill the vi area with blank lines,
               change  the  window's view to display those lines,
               and move the caret to position 0.0.

          vvii lleeaavvee
               Leave vi mode.  Delete the lines in the  vi  area,
               move  the caret back to the end of the typescript,
               and change the window's view to display the end of
               the typescript.

          vvii ccdd
               Clear all the lines on the screen at or below  the
               caret position, leaving the caret at the beginning
               of its (now-blank) line.  This command is provided
               primarily for emulating the ccdd termcap entry.

          vvii ccee
               Clear from the caret position to the  end  of  the
               line, leaving the caret where it is.  This command
               is provided primarily for emulating the ccee termcap
               entry.

          vvii cclleeaarr
               Clear the lines in the vi area and move the  caret
               to the home position (0.0).

          vvii ccuurrssoorr _l_i_n_e_I_n_d_e_x _c_h_a_r_I_n_d_e_x
               Set the caret position to line _l_i_n_e_I_n_d_e_x,  charac-
               ter  _c_h_a_r_I_n_d_e_x.  This position must lie within the
               via area.

          vvii ddeelleetteelliinnee
               Delete the line containing the caret,  and  add  a
               new  line to the bottom of the vi area to keep the
               total number of lines in the via area constant.

          vvii iinnsseerrttlliinnee
               Add a new blank line to the vi area,  just  before
               the caret (the caret should be at the beginning of
               a line).  Delete the last line in the vi area,  in
               order  to keep the total number of lines in the vi
               area constant.

          vvii oonn
               Returns  a  non-zero  string  if  the  window   is
               currently in vi mode, and a zero string otherwise.

     TTxx stores an up-to-date termcap entry in the  tteerrmmccaapp  vari-
     able, and initializes the TERM and TERMCAP environment vari-
     ables when it starts up, so that you can run  programs  that
     use  termcap  information.   If  you change the size of a ttxx
     window, ttxx will update the tteerrmmccaapp variable and  invoke  the
     TIOCSWINSZ  ioctl  to  notify the application, but it cannot
     update the TERM and TERMCAP  environment  variables  in  the
     application;   you can use the ``Set Termcap'' menu entry to
     invoke shell commands to update TERM and  TERMCAP.   If  you
     use  ttxx to rlogin to a different machine, most machines have
     never heard of ttxx so they don't have entries for it in their
     /etc/termcap  files.   There  are  two possible solutions to
     this problem: a) you can invoke  the  ``Set  Termcap''  menu
     entry  after  you've gotten logged in to the remote machine;
     b) you can use the _t_x_i_n_f_o program as  part  of  your  .login
     shell  script, in order to set up the TERMCAP automatically.
     See the manual page for _t_x_i_n_f_o for details.

     The ooppeenn command may be used to open several windows on  the
     same  typescript.  The windows behave identically except for
     one thing: window size.  There is a single window size asso-
     ciated  with the typescript, which is returned when applica-
     tions perform TIOCGWINSZ ioctl  operations  on  the  pseudo-
     terminal.   If  the  different windows have different sizes,
     then Tx always uses the size from a particular  one  of  the
     windows   (usually   the   first   window   created  on  the
     typescript).  The other windows are  labelled  AAlltteerrnnaattee  at
     the  right  side  of their title bars to indicate that their
     sizes will not be reflected to the application.
