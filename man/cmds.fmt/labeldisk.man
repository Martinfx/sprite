          Read the label from this device.

     --ww   Write a new label.

     --qq   Write a new label quickly, without prompting for parti-
          tion information.

     --ssuunn Write out a Sun label.  The default is to  write  what-
          ever type of label was read.

     --ddeecc Write out a Dec label.

     --nneeww Ignore any old label.

     _d_e_v_i_c_e
          The device file with the disk label.  Without --ffrroomm  it
          is  the  device that the label is read from and written
          to, otherwise it is the device that is written to.

     This reads the disk label and verifies its checksum.  If the
     --ffrroomm  ffrroommDDeevviiccee  option  is present then the disk label is
     read from the ffrroommDDeevviiccee, and the  ddeevviiccee  argument  becomes
     the device to which the label is written to.

     If the --ww option is present labeldisk interactively  prompts
     for partition information.  After this the user is presented
     with the new label and given the opportunity to  commit  the
     change  or  abort  it.  The user is also given the chance to
     write the label to all of the valid partitions found on  the
     device.   ``valid''  means that the partition has a positive
     number of cylinders associated with it, and that a file sys-
     tem  exists on the partition.  If a partition on the disk is
     not ``valid'', then it is skipped.  An attempt  is  made  to
     write  the label to the raw disk in the improbable case that
     no valid partition starts on cylinder 0.  If  labeldisk  was
     not  able  to write the label to the raw disk or to a parti-
     tion that begins at cylinder 0, then a warning is issued  to
     that effect.

     The --qq option turns off the prompting for partition informa-
     tion only.  This is useful for copying a label from one par-
     tition on one device to other partitions on the same or dif-
     ferent  device  if the user knows that the label on the from
     device  has  the  correct  information.   Overrides  the  --ww
     option.

     The --ddeecc option converts the label being written  to  a  dec
     label.

     The --ssuunn option converts the label being written  to  a  dec
     label.

     The --nneeww option ignores any label read, and  creates  a  new
     one  instead.   If  either  the  --ddeecc  or the --ssuunn option is
     specified then the new label created  is  of  the  specified
     type.

     Each disk is divided into 8 partitions,  named  ``ai''  thru
     ``gi''.    Each  partition  is  specified  with  a  starting
     cylinder number and the number  of  cylinders  it  contains.
     Unused  partitions  are  indicated with a zero size.  Parti-
     tions can overlap, but overlapping partitions  should  never
     be used simultaneously!  Traditionally partition ``ai'' is a
     small partition suitable for the root or a small /tmp.  Par-
     tition  ``bi''  is  a  slightly larger system suitable for a
     single machine's swap directory.  Partition ``ci'' is a sin-
     gle  large  partition that specifies the whole disk.  Parti-
     tions ``di'' and ``ei'' are often used as  large  partitions
     beyond  ``ai''  and ``bi''.  Partition ``gi'' is usually set
     up as all the space after  ``ai''  and  ``bi''.   Partitions
     ``fi'' and ``hi'' usually aren't used, but they can be.

     Partitions are useful to quarantine different sets of  users
     from  one another, although they are a pain to change once a
     filesystem has been created on them.  Changing them requires
     recreating any affected filesystems.
