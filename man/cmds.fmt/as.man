     _a_s translates assembly code in the named _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e into exe-
     cutable object code in the specified _o_b_j_f_i_l_e.

     All undefined symbols in the assembly are treated as global.

     The output of the assembly is left in the file _o_b_j_f_i_l_e.

     --dd22  Specifies that instruction offsets involving forward or
          external references and having sizes unspecified in the
          assembly language are two bytes long.  The default is
          four bytes. See also the --jj option.

     --ee   Allows control sections to begin on any two-byte boun-
          dary, rather than only four-byte boundaries.

     --hh   Suppress span-dependent instruction calculations and
          force all branches to be of medium length, but all
          calls to take the most general form. This is used when
          assembly must be minimized, while program size and
          run-time are unimportant.  This option results in a
          smaller and faster program than that produced by the --JJ
          option, but some very large programs may not be able to
          use it because of the limits of the medium-length
          branches.

     --jj   Use short (pc-relative) branches to resolve jump's and
          jsr's to externals.  This is for compact programs which
          cannot use the --dd22 flag because of large program relo-
          cation.

     --JJ   Suppress span-dependent instruction calculations and
          force all branches and calls to take the most general
          form. This is used when assembly time must be minim-
          ized, but program size and run time are not important.

     --LL   Save defined labels beginning with an `L', which are
          normally discarded to save space in the resultant sym-
          bol table.  The compilers generate such temporary
          labels.

     --mmcc6688001100

          and put the MC68010 machine-type tag in the object
          file.  This is the default on Sun-2's.

     --mmcc6688002200
          Accept the full MC68020, MC68881 and the Sun FPA
          instruction sets and addressing modes, and put the
          MC68020 machine-type tag in the object file.  This is
          the default on Sun 3's.

     --oo   The next argument is taken as the name of the object
          file to be produced.  If the --oo flag isn't used, the
          _o_b_j_f_i_l_e is named _a.._o_u_t.

     --OO   Perform span-dependent instruction resolution over
          entire files rather than just over individual pro-
          cedures.

     --RR   Make initialized data segments read-only by concatenat-
          ing them to the text segments.  This eliminates the
          need to run editor scripts on assembly code to make
          initialized data read-only and shared.

     The Pascal compiler, _p_c, qualifies a nested procedure name
     by chaining the names of the enclosing procedures.  This
     sometimes results in names long enough to abort the assem-
     bler, which currently limits identifiers to 512 characters.
