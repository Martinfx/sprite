     This command will retrieve the Sx selection in ``text'' for-
     mat  and output it onto the standard output.  If there is no
     selection, no output is generated.  The main purpose of this
     command is to allow you to write shell commands that use the
     selection, e.g. to print it or to delete a file  whose  name
     is selected.
