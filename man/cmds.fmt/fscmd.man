     This command is used to set various  kernel  variables  that
     control  the filesystem cache, tracing and debugging output,
     and other features of the system.  It is  implemented  using
     the Fs_Command system call.

CCAACCHHEE SSIIZZEE
     The minimum and  maximum  number  of  filesystem  blocks  (4
     Kbytes  each)  in  the  main memory cache is set with the -m
     (minimum) and -M  (maximum)  arguments.   Follow  either  of
     these with the number of 4-Kbyte blocks, ie.  -M 512 means a
     max of 2 Megabytes in the cache.

CCAACCHHEE CCOONNTTRROOLL
     --ff   The entire contents of the cache gets written-back  and
          then invalidated by specifying --ff.

     --ss [00|11]
          The background process that writes back dirty data from
          the  cache  can  be disabled by specifying the ``--ss 00''
          flag.  This should be  done  when  patching  a  mounted
          filesystem  or  else  bad  internal structures will get
          pushed to disk.  Enable the sync daemon with ``--ss 11''.

     --ll [00|11]
          Biasing against ``large'' files in the cache is enabled
          with ``--ll 11'' and turned off with ``--ll 00''.

     --LL _s_i_z_e
          This sets what portion of the maximum cache size a file
          must  occupy before it is considered a large file.  For
          example a value of 8 would indicate that if a  file  is
          larger  than  1/8  of the maximum cache size then it is
          considered a large file.

     --CC [00|11]
          Caching on diskless nodes can  be  disabled  with  ``--CC
          00'',  and turned back on with ``--CC 11''.  This has to be
          done on a file server to affect its clients; use of the
          -C flag on clients will have no effect.

     --NN [00|11]
          The name cache on a diskfull node is disabled with ``--NN
          00'' and enabled with ``--NN 11''.

     --vv [00|11]
          The Virtual Memory cache of recently used program  seg-
          ments  is  disabled with ``--vv 11'' (yes, 1), and enabled
          with ``--vv 00''.

     --bb _N Set the maximum  number  of  block  cleaner  processes.
          This controls the amount of overlap during cache write-
          backs.  3 processes provides the most bandwidth, but it
          does load the server.

     --rr _N Set the read ahead distance (in  4K  blocks).   When  a
          read  on  the  cache  is  done,  the transfer of N more
          blocks is initiated.

CCAACCHHEE WWRRIITTEE BBAACCKK PPOOLLIICCYY
     Normally, dirty blocks in the file system cache are aged for
     at  least  30 seconds before being written back.  This gives
     the best performance, although alternate strategies  can  be
     tried  out  with  the following flags.  There are two write-
     back policies involved: the client's and the server's.  Each
     of  the flags below only affects the policy on the client or
     server on which it is invoked.  For example the client could
     be  using a write-through policy and the server a 30-second-
     delay policy.  This would mean that client writes would  not
     complete  until the blocks have been written across the net-
     work into the server's cache, but the blocks  would  not  be
     written back to disk until at least 30 seconds later.

     --SS _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
          Set the cache write-back interval in seconds.

     --ww [00|11]
          Write-through caching is enabled with ``--ww 11'' and dis-
          abled  with  ``--ww  00''.   With write-through, the write
          system call does not complete until the cache block  is
          written back.

     --WW [[00|11]
          Write-back-on-close caching is enabled  with  ``--WW  11''
          and  disabled  with ``--WW 00''.  With write-back-on-close
          the close system call does not complete  until  all  of
          the file's dirty blocks are written back.

     --xx [00|11]
          Write-back of temporary files can be set  to  delay  as
          long  as  possible  with  ``--xx 11''.  This is turned off
          with ``--xx 00''.  Normally temporary files are files that
          are in the /tmp directory.

     --XX _d_i_r_N_u_m_b_e_r
          This identifies the temporary  directory  to  the  file
          system.   _d_i_r_N_u_m_b_e_r should be the inode number of /tmp.
          Unfortunately, only one temporary directory  is  under-
          stood.

     --yy [00|11]
          Write-back-as-soon-as-possible caching is enabled  with
          ``--yy  11''  and  turned  off with ``--yy 00''.  With write-
          back-ASAP, the write system call completes  immediately
          and  the cache block is scheduled to be written out as-
          soon-as-possible.

     --zz [00|11]
          Write-back-on-last-dirty-block caching is enabled  with
          ``--zz  11''  and  turned  off with ``--zz 00''.  This policy
          only works on a server.  It  means  the  server  writes
          back its blocks for a file after getting the last dirty
          block for the file from a client.   For  example,  this
          policy  combined with a write-back-on-close client pol-
          icy would mean that after a client closes a  file,  all
          of  the  files  blocks  are  guaranteed  to  be  on the
          server's disk.

DDIISSKK LLAAYYOOUUTT
     --BB _s_k_e_w
          Set the block skew for disk allocation.  Not  supported
          in kernel yet.

TTRRAACCIINNGG//DDEEBBUUGG FFLLAAGGSS
     There are several  tracing/debugging  flags  that  can  have
     their  value  set  via ffssccmmdd.  Each flag expects a following
     integer on the command line that will specify the new  value
     of  the  flag or trace level variable.  FFssccmmdd prints out the
     old value of the flag as it changes it.  Some of  the  flags
     are  Booleans  that are set with values of 1 for TRUE, and 0
     for FALSE.

     --OO   The fsStats structure is zeroed out.  This  information
          is displayed with the fsStat program.

     --tt [00|11]
          Filesystem tracing is  enabled  with  ``--tt  11''.   This
          dumps  internal  events  into  a circular trace record.
          The trace  gets  printed  via  a  special  console  key
          sequence, ``LL11--ff''.

     --DD [00|11]
          Cache consistency debug print statements are turned  on
          with ``--DD 11'', and turned off with ``--DD 00''.

     --RR [00|11]
