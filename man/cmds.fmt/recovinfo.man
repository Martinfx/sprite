     This command prints  out  information  about  what  I/O  and
     stream  handles  would  need  to  be  recovered if access to
     servers were interrupted.  Without any  arguments,  it  just
     prints  a  summary  of  information, including the number of
     file I/O handles that would need to be recovered, the number
     of files with no associated stream, the number of files with
     no stream and no cache blocks, the number of files  with  no
     stream  and  no dirty blocks, the number of files with dirty
     blocks, and the total number of handles that would  need  to
     be recovered at this time.  This summary information is use-
     ful for  determining  where  we  can  discard  work  in  our
     recovery system.
