DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     vvii (visual) is a display oriented text editor based on
     eexx(1).  eexx and vvii are, in fact, the same text editor; it is
     possible to get to the command mode of eexx from within vvii and
     vice-versa.

     The vviieeww command runs vvii with the rreeaaddoonnllyy variable set.
     With vviieeww, you can browse through files interactively
     without making any changes.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     --ll   Set up for editing LISP programs.

     --rr   Recover the named files after a crash.

     --RR   Edit files in read only state.  This has the same
          effect as the vviieeww command.

     --xx   Prompt for a key with which to encrypt the file or
          files being edited.

     --tt _t_a_g
          Edit the file containing _t_a_g.  There must be a tags
          database in the directory, built by ccttaaggss(1), that con-
          tains a reference to _t_a_g.

     ++_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
          Start the editing session by executing _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

     ++_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
          Start the editing session by executing _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The editor recognizes the environment variable as a command
     (or list of commands separated by || characters) to run when
     it starts up.  If this variable is undefined, the editor
     checks for startup commands in the file ~~//..eexxrrcc file, which
     you must own.  However, if there is a ..eexxrrcc owned by you in
     the current directory, the editor takes its startup commands
     from this file - overriding both the file in your home
     directory and the environment variable.

BBUUGGSS
     Software TAB characters using CTRL-T work only immediately
     after the aauuttooiinnddeenntt.

     SHIFT-left and SHIFT-right on intelligent terminals do not
     make use of insert and delete character operations in the
     terminal.

     The wwrraappmmaarrggiinn option can be fooled since it looks at output
     columns when blanks are typed.  If a long word passes
     through the margin and onto the next line without a break,
     then the line will not be broken.

     Repeating a change which wraps over the margin when wwrraappmmaarr--
     ggiinn is in effect does not generally work well: sometimes it
     just makes a mess of the change, and sometimes even leaves
     you in insert mode.  A way to work around the problem is to
     replicate the changes using yy (yank) and pp (put).

     Insert/delete within a line can be slow if TAB characters
     are present on intelligent terminals, since the terminals
     need help in doing this correctly.

     Saving text on deletes in the named buffers is somewhat
     inefficient.

     The _s_o_u_r_c_e command does not work when executed as `::ssoouurrccee';
     there is no way to use the `::aappppeenndd', `::cchhaannggee', and
     `::iinnsseerrtt' commands, since it is not possible to give more
     than one line of input to a `::' escape.  To use these on a
     `::gglloobbaall' you must QQ to _e_x command mode, execute them, and
     then reenter the screen editor with vvii or ooppeenn.

     When using the --rr option to recover a file, you must write
     the recovered text before quitting or you will lose it.  vvii
     does not prevent you from exiting without writing unless you
     make changes.

     vvii does not adjust when the SunView window in which it runs
     is resized.

RREESSTTRRIICCTTIIOONNSS
     The encryption facilities of vvii are not available on
     software shipped outside the U.S.
