     This program prints out kernel statistics in a raw, uninter-
     preted  format.   This  allows  all the counters kept by the
     kernel to be dumped and processed later.  The program  first
     prints  a  line  containing  the host's name and the current
     time.  Then, if  --nnooiiddllee  is  not  specified,  the  kernel's
     Sched_Instruments information is printed.  This includes the
     idle time of the host (see  <kernel/sched.h>).   Then  other
     statistics  are  printed  depending on the options.  See the
     indicated header files for further documentation.  If  --zzeerroo
     is  specified then all fields, even those with a zero valued
     counter, are printed.

     This program is semi-automatically generated with  the  help
     of  the  printFields  awk  script that is kept in the source
     directory.
