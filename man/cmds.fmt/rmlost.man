     --ii            Interactive option. rmlost asks for  confirma-
                   tion  for  each  group  of  files  found  in a
                   filesystem before it deletes them.

     --vv            Verbose option. Prints helpful messages as  it
                   proceeds.

     --aa            Examine all filesystems. This can be a lengthy
                   process.

     RRmmlloosstt cleans out a user's files in  the  lost+found  direc-
     tories.   With  no arguments, /lost+found is checked, other-
     wise the specified  filesystems  are  checked.   If  the  --aa
     option  is  given, all the filesystems generated with the ddff
     command are examined.

     For each filesystem, all the files owned  by  the  user  are
     removed.   If  the  --ii  option  is  given,  confirmation  is
     requested before the deletion is performed.

BBUUGGSS
     Perl doesn't seem to let you ^C  the  script.  To  kill  the
     thing, type ^Z and issue a KILL to the process
