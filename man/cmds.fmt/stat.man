     Stat is used to print out attributes of files.   Its  output
     is  self-explainitory  and is a super-set of the output from
     the llss --ll command, which can also be obtained  with  the  --ss
     option.   The  extra  attributes  presented are the internal
     version number of the file that is incremented each time the
     file is re-written, the user-defined file type, the creation
     date, the file server ID, the file domain  (disk),  and  the
     file  number.   For  devices this also prints out the device
     serverID, type, and unit.  A device serverID of -1 indicates
     that  it  is  a common device found on all hosts.  Opening a
     common device attaches you to the  instance  of  the  device
     connected to the current host.

     User IDs and hostIDs are given in numerical form,  not  nice
     string names.
