     --aa            Print out information for processes  belonging
                   to  all  users  (normally  only  the  invoking
                   user's processes are printed).

     --AA            Print  out  information  for  absolutely   all
                   processes, even dead ones.

     --dd            Print information only for processes in  DEBUG
                   state.

     --hheellpp         Print out a  help  message  and  exit  without
                   doing anything else.

     --ii            Instead of  the  default  status  information,
                   print  information  about  various process ids
                   (includes the PID, PPID, GROUP,  USER,  RUSER,
                   TIME, and COMMAND fields).

     --kk            Print  out  information  for   kernel   server
                   processes  in  addition to any other processes
                   requested with other switches.

     --ll            Use local information for  migrated  processes
                   rather  than  following  them to their current
                   hosts.

     --mm            Print information only for processes that  are
                   migrated to or from another machine.

     --MM            Instead of  the  default  status  information,
                   print   information  about  process  migration
                   (includes the PID, STATE, FLAGS, EVENT, RNODE,
                   RPID, and COMMAND fields).

     --ss            Instead of  the  default  status  information,
                   print  information about signals (includes the
                   PID, PENDING, HELD, IGNORE, HANDLE,  and  COM-
                   MAND fields).

     --uu            Instead of  the  default  status  information,
                   print  additional  ``user-oriented''  informa-
                   tion, including PID, %CPU,  %MEM,  SIZE,  RSS,
                   STATE, TIME, PRI, and COMMAND.

     --vv            Instead of  the  default  status  information,
                   print virtual memory information (includes the
                   PID, CODSZ, CODRS, HPSZ, HPRS,  STKSZ,  STKRS,
                   SIZE, RSS, and COMMAND fields).

     --ww _l_i_n_e_W_i_d_t_h  Use _l_i_n_e_W_i_d_t_h as the output line  length,  and
                   format  output so that it fits neatly on lines
                   of this length.  The COMMAND field gets  trun-
                   cated as necessary to accomplish this.

     This command prints out process status information.  If  one
     or  more  _p_i_d's  is  given,  then information is printed for
     those processes.  If no _p_i_d is given,  then  information  is
     printed  for  all  processes  belonging to the invoking user
     (additional processes may be requested  with  switches  like
     --aa).

     By default, ppss prints a short status report  for  each  pro-
     cess,  containing  the PID, STATE, TIME, and COMMAND fields.
     Other forms of printout are available using switches like --uu
     and --mm.

     The names of fields printed by ppss (which appear at the  tops
     of  the  columns  of  ppss  printout),  and the meaning of the
     information printed in the fields, are:

     CCOODDRRSS        The amount of physical memory occupied by  this
                  process's code segment, in units of 1024 bytes.

     CCOODDSSZZ        The total size of this process's code  segment,
                  in  units  of  1024  bytes.  Not all of this is
                  necessarily resident in memory.

     CCOOMMMMAANNDD      The command  that  the  process  is  executing.
                  This field gets truncated if necessary to avoid
                  running off the end of the line.   Use  the  --ww
                  switch  to  request  a  longer  line  size when
                  needed.

     EEVVEENNTT        The _e_v_e_n_t field from the process control  block
                  (printed in hexadecimal).  See the include file
                  <kernel/proc.h> for further information.

     FFLLAAGGSS        The _g_e_n_F_l_a_g_s field  from  the  process  control
                  block   (printed   in  hexadecimal).   See  the
                  include file <kernel/proc.h> for further infor-
                  mation.

     GGRROOUUPP        The  process  group  to  which   this   process
                  belongs.

     HHAANNDDLLEE       A hexadecimal value giving a  bit-mask  of  the
                  signals  for  which  the  process has specified
                  handler procedures.

     HHEELLDD         A hexadecimal value giving a  bit-mask  of  the
                  signals   currently  ``held''  (prevented  from
                  being delivered to the process at its request).

     HHPPRRSS         The amount of physical memory occupied by  this
                  process's heap segment, in units of 1024 bytes.

                  signals currently being ignored by the process

     PPPPIIDD         The process id of the parent of this process.

     PPRRII          The priority of the  process.   Processes  with
                  normal   priority  have  no  specific  priority
                  listed.  Server processes, with infinite prior-
                  ity,  are  listed as "S". Processes with above-
                  normal  priority  are  listed   as   ">",   and
                  processes with below-normal priority are listed
                  as "<".  Processes with  VERY_LOW_PRIORITY  are
                  listed as "<<".

     PPEENNDDIINNGG      A hexadecimal value giving a  bit-mask  of  the
                  signals  that are awaiting delivery to the pro-
                  cess.

     RRNNOODDEE        For a migrated  process,  this  identifies  the
                  ``other'' node that the process belongs to (its
                  home node if this is the remote node,  or  vice
                  versa).

     RRPPIIDD         For a migrated process, this contains the id of
                  the  process  on  its  ``other'' node (its home
                  node if  this  is  the  remote  node,  or  vice
                  versa).

     RRSSSS          Resident set size:  the total  physical  memory
                  occupied  by  this  process,  in  units of 1024
                  bytes.  This is the sum  of  CODRS,  HPRS,  and
                  STKRS.

     RRUUSSEERR        The name of the user corresponding to the  real
                  user ID of this process.

     SSIIZZEE         The total amount of virtual memory allocated to
                  this  process, in units of 1024 bytes.  Not all
                  of this memory is necessary resident in  physi-
                  cal  memory,  and  some of it may not even have
                  been accessed.  SIZE is equal  to  the  sum  of
                  CODSZ, HPSZ, and STKSZ.

     SSTTAATTEE        The current execution state of the process.

     SSTTKKRRSS        The amount of physical memory occupied by  this
                  process's  stack  segment,  in  units  of  1024
                  bytes.

     SSTTKKSSZZ        The total size of this process's heap  segment,

     TTIIMMEE         The total CPU time consumed by the process,  in
                  minutes  and  seconds.  This time includes both
                  kernel and user time.

     UUSSEERR         The user name corresponding  to  the  effective
                  user ID of this process.

     %%CCPPUU         A smoothed average of the  fraction  of  a  CPU
                  that  this  process  has consumed over the last
                  several seconds.

     %%MMEEMM         The fraction of total physical memory  occupied
                  by  this  process's segments.  Does not include
                  memory that  belongs  to  the  process  but  is
                  swapped out.
