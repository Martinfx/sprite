                    The parallelism is limited by  the  _g_r_o_u_p  of
                    each device (see below), and the --jj flag.  If
                    this  flag  is  used  then  at  most  _m_a_x_J_o_b_s

     FFssaattttaacchh is used during system boot to check the  disks  for
     inconsistencies  and to export prefixes.  The input to ffssaatt--
     ttaacchh is a mount table, usually in  /_h_o_s_t_s/$_H_O_S_T/_m_o_u_n_t.   The
     location  of  the mount table is specified by the --mm option.
     FFssaattttaacchh uses the pass information in  the  mount  table  to
     create  child processes that check the disk partitions using
     ffsscchheecckk.  The output from ffsscchheecckk is appended to a file with
     the  same  name  as  the  device  and the suffix ".fsc".  If
     ffsscchheecckk completes normally, then the filesystem  is  mounted
     and its prefix exported.

MMOOUUNNTT TTAABBLLEE
     The mount table contains information on checking  the  disks
     and  on exporting prefixes.  Each line in the table consists
     of a command and its arguments. Blank lines and  lines  that
     begin  with  '#' are ignored.  The AAttttaacchh command is used to
     check a disk partition and to attach the  partition  to  the
     file system. AAttttaacchh commands have the following format:

     AAttttaacchh _p_r_e_f_i_x _d_e_v_i_c_e _g_r_o_u_p _s_c_o_p_e _a_c_c_e_s_s

     _P_r_e_f_i_x is the prefix under which to mount the partition.

     The _d_e_v_i_c_e is the device on which  to  run  fscheck  and  to
     attach.

     The _g_r_o_u_p parameter is used to determine the parallelism  in
     checking  the disks. FFsscchheecckk is a very IO constrained appli-
     cation. Most of the execution time is spent waiting for  the
     disk.  If  the system has more than one disk the overall run
     time of ffssaattttaacchh can  be  decreased  by  checking  different
     disks  at the same time.  _F_s_a_t_t_a_c_h will run jobs in parallel
     if possible.  Any partitions that  are  in  the  same  group
     will  NOT  be  checked  in  parallel.   A  group name is any
     sequence of characters and is  case  sensitive.   The  group
     name  "root"  has  special  significance.  It is used as the
     group of the root  partition.   This  partition  is  checked
     before  all  other  partitions,  and  the server may have to
     reboot if an error is found in this partition.

     The _s_c_o_p_e can be either local  or  export.  Partitions  with
     local scope are attached only for the local machine, whereas
     partitions with export scope are attached and exported under
     the given prefix.  The prefix corresponding to the root par-
     tition (usually /bootTmp) is attached during system boot and

     is not reattached by ffssaattttaacchh.  For this partition the scope
     parameter does not have any effect.

     The _a_c_c_e_s_s is used to set the access permissions of the pre-
     fix.  If  the access is "r" then the prefix is read only. If
     the access is "rw" then the prefix is can be both  read  and
     written.   The  access parameter has no effect if the parti-
     tion is the root partition.

     The EExxppoorrtt command is used to export a prefix under  a  dif-
     ferent name.  EExxppoorrtt commands have the following format:

     EExxppoorrtt _p_r_e_f_i_x _l_o_c_a_l_P_a_t_h

     _P_r_e_f_i_x is the name of the prefix to be exported.

     _L_o_c_a_l_P_a_t_h is the name of a path that is to  be  exported  as
     _p_r_e_f_i_x.

     All other non-comment lines are  interpreted  as  containing
     arguments to ffsscchheecckk.  The format of these lines is:

     _d_e_v_i_c_e_N_a_m_e [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]

     _D_e_v_i_c_e_N_a_m_e is the name of the device for which ffsscchheecckk is to
     use  the  _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s. A device name of aallll will cause ffsscchheecckk
     to use the arguments for all devices. Any  number  of  argu-
     ments  can  follow the device name, as long as they fit on a
     single line. The same device name can appear on  any  number
     of lines.

     The following is a sample mount table. The root partition is
     /_d_e_v/_r_s_d_0_a  and  it is exported under the prefix /_t_1. /_t_2 is
     another small partition on the same disk. /_b is a large par-
     tition  on  the disk, and /_a is a large partition that is an
     entire second disk.
