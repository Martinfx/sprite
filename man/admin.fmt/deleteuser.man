     DDeelleetteeuusseerr takes a list of account names  and  removes  them
     from  the  system.  The  user's  account is removed from the
     password file and the user's home directory is flushed.   In
     addition,  an  editor is invoked on the system aliases file,
     so that the user can be removed from any mailing  lists  she
     might belong to.

     DDeelleetteeuusseerr can also remove partially  created  or  partially
     deleted accounts, though it squawks a bit.
