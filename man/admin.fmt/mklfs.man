                   created.  This  device should be a disk parti-
                   tion complete with a disk label that specifies
                   its  size.  WARNING: THE CONTENTS OF THIS DEV-

     _p_r_e_f_i_x        Name of the file  system  (its  prefix).   You
                   only  need  to specify this prefix if you wish
                   to have the file system automatically  mounted
                   by  ffssmmoouunntt during the boot sequence.  You can
                   manually mount the file system under any  name
                   you want via the pprreeffiixx command.

                   _N_u_m_C_a_c_h_e_B_l_o_c_k_s is the maximum number  of  file
                   cache  blocks  available  on the machine. This
                   number defaults to the maximum number  on  the
                   machine running the program.

                   _N_u_m_C_a_c_h_e_B_l_o_c_k_s is the maximum number  of  file
                   cache  files  that will be reserved for clean-
                   ing. A negative value causes mklfs to  compute
                   this  number  based  on  the  segment and file
                   cache size.

     --sspprriitteeIIDD _i_d  _i_d is the Sprite hostname id specified in  the
                   superblock.   This  id  is  used  to  inform a
                   machine of its name at boot time.  It defaults
                   to the Sprite ID of the machine running mklfs.

                   _U_t_i_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n is the  maximum  fraction  of  the
                   disk space usable by the file system.

                   _N_u_m_D_e_s_c is the maximum number  of  descriptors
                   available in the file system. A negative value
                   causes mklfs to compute this number  based  on
                   the disk size.

                   _s_i_z_e is block  size  of  the  file  system  in
                   bytes.  The  block size is the minimum unit of
                   allocation and should be  a  multiple  of  the
                   device's sector size.

     --sseeggmmeennttSSiizzee _s_i_z_e
                   _s_i_z_e is the segment size of the file system in
                   bytes.  The  segment size should be a multiple
                   of the block size.

     --nnuummSSeeggmmeennttss _N_u_m_S_e_g_m_e_n_t_s
                   _N_u_m_S_e_g_m_e_n_t_s is the number of segments  to  use
                   on  the  file  system. A negative value causes
                   mklfs to compute the number of segments  based
                   on the size of the disk.

     --ddeessccBBlloocckkSSiizzee _s_i_z_e
                   _s_i_z_e is the size in bytes of the  blocks  used
                   to  store  file  descriptors  in the log. This
                   number should be a multiple of the block size.

     --ddeessccMMaappBBlloocckkSSiizzee _s_i_z_e
                   _s_i_z_e is the block size in byte  used  for  the
                   descriptor  map  data  structure.  This number
                   should be a multiple of the block size.

                   segment   usage  array  data  structure.  This
                   number should be a multiple of the block size.

     MMkkllffss will create an empty Sprite LFS filesystem on  a  disk
     partition.  The filesystem is created to use the entire disk
     partition and initialized to look like an  Sprite  LFS  file
     system  containing a root directory with a lost+found direc-
     tory.  Care should be taken because anything already present
     on the partition will be overwritten.

     MMkkllffss has a large number of options that control the maximum
     limits  of  various file system data structures, the charac-
     teristic of the machine that will the device  for  the  file
     system,  and  the  disk  layout format the file system.  All
     options except the deviceName  specifier  are  optional  and
     default  to reasonable values if not specified.  If the pro-
     gram is being run on a machine other than the one  that  the
