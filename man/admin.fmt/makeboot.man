     MMaakkeebboooott copies a boot program and removes the a.out  header
     as  it does so.  The boot program is loaded by the PROM into
     memory and execution begins at word 0, so the  a.out  header
     must  be  removed.   This  program also knows where the boot
     program ought to be installed, so without the _t_a_r_g_e_t_B_o_o_t_F_i_l_e
     argument  it will do the right thing.  Typically mmaakkeebboooott is
     used to install network boot programs.  These are loaded  by
     the PROM using TFTP, which looks in the standard boot direc-
     tory.


SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     installboot, which copies a disk boot program onto the  disk
     header and strips the a.out header as it does so.


FFIILLEESS
     /sprite/boot   - Directory containing per-machine TFTP  boot
     files.   These  are  typically  symbolic  links  to machine-
     dependent boot programs.
     /sprite/boot.$MACHINE    - Home for  the  machine  dependent
     boot programs.
