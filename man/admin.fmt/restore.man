     The rreessttoorree command is used to restore  a  file  or  set  of
     files  from  a dump archive.  The dump archive is created by
     the dduummpp command.  If a specified path  is  a  single  file,
     then that file is restored.  If it is a directory, all files
     contained in that directory will  be  recursively  restored.
     If  the  path is a shell syntax regular expression, then all
     files in the dump archive matching the  expression  will  be
     restored.

     All the specified paths  should  be  absolute,  hard  paths.
     I.e.,  they should start with the root directory, and should
     not contain any symbolic links.  Be especially careful  when
     restoring something to your home directory because most home
     directories on Sprite are symbolic  links  from  the  /users
     directory.
