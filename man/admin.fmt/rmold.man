                    control deletion.

     --pprriinntt         Do not actually delete any files;  just print

     The rrmmoolldd program  deletes  all  of  the  named  files  that
     haven't  been  accessed in the last _n_u_m_D_a_y_s days.  It prints
     the names of all the files it deleted.  If the  --mmoodd  switch
     is given, then rrmmoolldd deletes all the files that haven't been
     modified in _n_u_m_D_a_y_s days.  If --pprriinntt is specified then rrmmoolldd
     prints  the  names  of  files that haven't been accessed (or
     modified) in _n_u_m_D_a_y_s, but it doesn't delete any of them.

     If ttiimmeessFFrroomm is specified, rrmmoolldd will  use  the  access  (or
     modify)  time  of the same-named file in the given alternate
     directory.  This option lets you  delete  old  backup  files
     after  the installed version of the file has been around for
     awhile.  For example, to delete backup  copies  of  commands
     that were installed over 90 days ago, you could do something
     like

               cd /sprite/cmds.$MACHINE.old
               rmold -mod -timesFrom /sprite/cmds.$MACHINE 90 *
