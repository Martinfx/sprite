     This script grovels over the dduummppddaatteess file  and  calculates
     how  much  space  on  the  tape  is taken by the dumps, file
     marks, etc.  The tape number is the first  argument.   (Each
     dump tape has a number, which is written on the tape and its
     case.)  The second argument is the  path  of  the  dduummppddaatteess
     file, usually //sspprriittee//aaddmmiinn//dduummpp//dduummppddaatteess.

     The output from the script gives how much space is taken for
     each  day's  dumps  (including a guess at how much is needed
     for file marks) and the total space taken on the tape.  This
     lets  you  guess  how  much space will be needed for another
     day's dumps and whether it  will  fit  on  the  given  tape.
     (Allow 2 gigabytes for an Exabyte cassette.)
