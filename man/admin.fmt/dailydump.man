     This script does a level-1 dump of all filesystems that  are
     normally  backed  up.   (A level-1 dump captures all changes
     since the previous level-0 dump for the  given  filesystem.)
     It  is  normally  invoked in the wee hours of the morning by
     ccrroonn.

     When the script has completed, it sends mail to the  current
     dumper  (see the man page for wweeeekkllyydduummpp), giving the amount
     of free space left  on  the  current  tape.   If  there  are
     detectable  errors, mail is sent to the dumper with an error
     message.

     There are normally two reasons for manually invoking  ddaaiillyy--
     dduummpp.   The  first is to re-enable the daily dumps after the
     weekly dumps have completed.  This is what the --ii option  is
     for.  It ensures that the lock file used by the weekly dumps
     is gone, and it initializes the tape currently in the drive.
     (The dumps won't actually commence until invoked by ccrroonn).

     The other reason for invoking ddaaiillyydduummpp by hand is  to  res-
     tart  the  dumps  if the machine running them crashed before
     the dumps could  finish.   In  this  case  the  user  should
     specify  the  filesystem  that  was  being  dumped  when the
     machine crashed.  The dumps will begin immediately.

     When invoking ddaaiillyydduummpp, be sure you're running as root.
