     The dduummpp command is used to do an incremental dump of a  set
     of  directory.   It will recursively dump all files and sub-
     directories.  Each file that has been  created  or  modified
     since  the  last  lower  level  dump  will  be copied to the
     archive file.  For example, the command

          dump -l 2 -f /dev/tape0 /sprite

     will dump all files in the directory //sspprriittee in tar  format,
     to //ddeevv//ttaappee00.

     Dump tapes have a particular  format.  It  is  assumed  that
     blocks  on  the  tape  cannot be overwritten, so the tape is
     written in an append-only fashion.  When a tape is  initial-
     ized  a  file called the tape _l_a_b_e_l is written at the begin-
     ning of the tape. Each time a filesystem  is  dumped  a  new
     updated  tape  label  is  written to the end of the tape, so
     that the current tape label is always the last  one  on  the
     tape. The tape label is 16 Kbytes in size, and consists of a
     sequence of ASCII strings separated by newlines.  The  first
     string is of the form

          SPRITE DUMP TAPE, Version _v Level _x Tape _n

     where _v is the version of dduummpp that wrote the tape, xx is the
     level  of the dump tape, and nn is the dump tape number.  The
     version is intended to allow future versions of dduummpp  to  be
     backwards  compatible.  The level is filled in when the tape
     is initialized, but is otherwise unused.  It could  be  used
     by  dduummpp  and  higher-level software to automate the dumping
     process.

     Subsequent lines in the tape label contain a table  of  con-
     tents for the tape, and are of the form

          _T_a_p_e_N_u_m _F_i_l_e_N_u_m _M_B_D_u_m_p_e_d _M_B_L_e_f_t _D_a_t_e _F_i_l_e_S_y_s_t_e_m

     where _T_a_p_e_N_u_m is the tape number, _F_i_l_e_N_u_m is the file number
     on  tape  corresponding  to the current entry (starting with
     1), _M_B_D_u_m_p_e_d  is  the  number  of  MBytes  dumped  from  the
     filesystem,  _M_B_L_e_f_t is the number of MBytes remaining on the
     tape after the filesystem was dumped, _D_a_t_e is the date  when
     the filesystem was dumped, and _F_i_l_e_S_y_s_t_e_m is the name of the
     filesystem that was dumped.

          When a dump completes the information that  is  written
          into  the  tape  label  is also written into this file.
          Each line is of the form

          _T_a_p_e_N_u_m _F_i_l_e_N_u_m _M_B_D_u_m_p_e_d _M_B_L_e_f_t _D_a_t_e _F_i_l_e_S_y_s_t_e_m

          where _T_a_p_e_N_u_m is the tape number, _F_i_l_e_N_u_m is  the  file
          number  on  tape  corresponding  to  the  current entry
          (starting with 1), _M_B_D_u_m_p_e_d is  the  number  of  MBytes
          dumped  from  the  filesystem,  _M_B_L_e_f_t is the number of
          MBytes remaining on the tape after the  filesystem  was
          dumped,  _D_a_t_e  is  the  date  when  the  filesystem was
          dumped, and _F_i_l_e_S_y_s_t_e_m is the name  of  the  filesystem
          that was dumped.

          This file contains low-level debugging information that
          is printed out by dduummpp as it runs.

          This file contains information about the status of both
          the  tape drives and the tapes.  A line is added to the
          file each time a dump completes, and is of the form

          _D_r_i_v_e_T_y_p_e _S_e_r_i_a_l _T_a_p_e_N_u_m _M_B_D_u_m_p_e_d _E_r_r_o_r_R_a_t_e _D_a_t_e _D_e_v_i_c_e

          _D_r_i_v_e_T_y_p_e is the type of  drive  that  was  used  (e.g.
          EXB-8500).   _S_e_r_i_a_l  is the serial number of the drive.
          The combination of the drive  type  and  serial  number
          should  allow  tape  drives  to be uniquely identified.
          _T_a_p_e_N_u_m_b_e_r is the number of the  tape  that  was  used.
          _M_B_D_u_m_p_e_d  is  the  number  of  MBytes that were dumped.
          _E_r_r_o_r_R_a_t_e is the number  of  errors  per  tape  access,
          expressed  as  a percentage of tape accesses.  An error
          rate of 100% means that there was  an  average  of  one
          error  per  tape access.  The definition of an error is
          vendor specific but an increase in the error rate  over
          time  may indicate that a tape is wearing out or that a
          drive needs servicing.  The _D_a_t_e is the date  on  which
          the  dump  occurred,  and the _D_e_v_i_c_e is the name of the
          device as passed  to  the  dduummpp  command.   The  latter
          should  not  be  considered to uniquely identify a tape
          drive since the mapping between the device name and the
          device  can  change,  thus  the  drive  type and serial
          number should be used to look for an  increasing  error
          rate on a particular drive.
