     fsmount - Check disks and export prefixes

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     --WW             Check disks, but do not write changes.

     --ff             Don't check disks (fastboot).

     --vv             Have both ffssmmoouunntt and ffsscchheecckk  output verbose
                    information while running (the default).

     --nn             Don't attach disks or export prefixes.

     --pp             Print out actions but don't execute them.

     --hheellpp          Print a summary of the  command-line  options
                    and exit.

     --dd _d_e_v_i_c_e_D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                    Specifies the directory containing the device
                    files.  The default is "/dev/".

     --ii _s_p_r_i_t_e_I_D    Causes prefixes that this machine will export
                    to  be  preloaded  into the prefix table with
                    _s_p_r_i_t_e_I_D as the  server.  This  prevents  the
                    machine  from  broadcasting  for its own pre-
                    fixes while the disks are being checked.

     --ffsscchheecckk _f_s_c_h_e_c_k_P_r_o_g
                    Use this to specify  an  alternative  fscheck
                    program, i.e., when testing a new fscheck.

     --cc             Conditionally check the disks.  If the  disks
                    were  just  checked by _f_s_c_h_e_c_k and we are now
                    rebooting, then we don't have to check again.
                    If  the  --cc  flag  is  present then the disks
                    won't be rechecked.

     FFssmmoouunntt is used during system boot to check  the  disks  for
     inconsistencies and to export prefixes.  It is a replacement
     for ffssaattttaacchh, and is intented to be  used  without  a  mount
     table.   It uses ffssiinnffoo to determine what filesystems are on
     the disks connected  to  the  host,  ffsscchheecckk  to  check  the
     filesystems found (if they are OFS), and pprreeffiixx to mount and
     export them.  In this way, disks can  change  hosts,  change

     prefixes, or change parititioning without having to update a
     mount table file.

     FFssmmoouunntt does some checking before it  pprreeffiixxes  filesystems.
     If  it  finds filesystems whose cylinder extents overlap, it
     will only pprreeffiixx the larger of  the  filesystems.   If  more
     than  one  filesystem  has  the  same prefix, it will try to
     mount those filesystems until one successfully mounts and it
     will  ignore the remainder.  If a filesystem has a prefix of
     a filesystem already in the prefix table, it is ignored.

     Currently, ffssmmoouunntt detects and notes  root  partitions,  but
     does not try to either check or mount them.

     Upon  completion,  ffssmmoouunntt  creates  a  ffssmmoouunntteedd  file   in
     //hhoossttss//$$HHOOSSTT//ffssmmoouunntteedd  reporting the filesystems it mounted
     and exported, and when it did so.

     FFssmmoouunntt returns the same error codes as ffssaattttaacchh:

     0    No error.

     1    An error was found in the root  partition.  Reboot  the
          system. See ffsscchheecckk for details.

     2    A hard error occurred. There was some problem in either
          ffssaattttaacchh,  ffsscchheecckk,  or  pprreeffiixx that prevented ffssaattttaacchh
          from completing normally.

     3    FFsscchheecckk returned a soft error indication.  See  ffsscchheecckk
          for details.

     4    An error was found  in  the  root  partition,  but  the
          number of consecutive times that ffsscchheecckk was run and an
          error found exceeds the limit.
