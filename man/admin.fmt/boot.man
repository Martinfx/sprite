     boot - Description of Sprite boot options and behavior

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     There are a number of boot  options  that  can  be  used  to
     change  the  boot  behavior.  If you are unfamiliar with the
     booting process you  should  read  the  subsequent  sections
     before this one.

     --cc             Causes a fileserver to ignore  the  existence
                    of  /bootTmp/boot  and to boot as a dependent
                    fileserver.  This  is  useful   for   booting
                    fileservers with trashed disks.

     --ff             Causes a fileserver to boot without  checking
                    its  disks.  This can lead to corrupted disks
                    if the disks are not consistent  before  they
                    are  attached.  The  --ff  option should not be
                    used if the system halted abnormally.

     --ss             The --ss option causes the machine to  boot  in
                    single-user  mode.   A  login shell is run by
                    initsprite before both diskcmds and bootcmds.
                    Initsprite will continue when the login shell
                    exits.

     --xx             If the machine is a fileserver  it  will  run
                    /boot/rootcmds  after running /boot/diskcmds.
                    This option allows a non-root  fileserver  to
                    serve  as root.  Only the root fileserver has
                    the correct mount table for exporting "/"  --
                    the rootcmds file contains the necessary com-
                    mands for allowing a non-root  fileserver  to
                    export "/".

     The first couple sections of this  man  page  are  a  user's
     guide  to  booting  Sprite.   Note  that  these  are general
     instructions; each file  server  should  have  its  specific
     booting instructions posted near its console.

     The rest of the man page goes into  more  detail  about  the
     boot  process and is probably of interest only to people who
     hack Sprite.

     For all Suns except SPARCstation 2's the boot command  typed
     at the PROM has the format

          bb _x_x((_a,_b,_c))_k_e_r_n_e_l [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]

BOOT                 Administrative Commands                 BOOT



     For machines that are booted off of the network _x_x  is  usu-
     ally iiee or llee, depending on whether the machine has an Intel
     or Lance ethernet chip.  For machines that  boot  off  their
     disk,  _x_x is usually ssdd.  For SPARCstation 2's the boot com-
     mand is

          bb [_d_e_v_i_c_e] _k_e_r_n_e_l [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]

     where _d_e_v_i_c_e is usually nneett or ddiisskk.  (For SPARCstation  2's
     running  Sprite  at  Berkeley,  _d_e_v_i_c_e  normally defaults to
     nneett.)

     The magic  numbers  _a,  _b,  _c  in  parentheses  are  usually
     optional.  They specify information about the host that sup-
     plies the kernel (for booting off the net), disk  partition,
     etc.   For  network  booting,  the middle number is the last
     four digits of the IP address of the server.  You only  need
     to  specify  this  number  if the default doesn't work.  For
     example, to ensure that Murder boots  off  of  Allspice  (IP
     address 128.32.150.27), use

          bb llee((00,,996611bb))ssuunn33..mmdd//sspprriittee

     and to boot off of Ginger (IP address 128.32.150.28), use

          bb llee((00,,996611cc))ssuunn33..mmdd//sspprriittee

     The string _k_e_r_n_e_l tells which kernel to load and boot.  When
     booting  off  a disk, _k_e_r_n_e_l is usually just the name of the
     kernel, e.g., ``new'' or ``sprite''.  When booting  off  the
     net,  you  must also specify the machine-dependent directory
     that the kernel is found  in,  e.g.,  ``sun3.md/new''.   Use
     ssuunn33..mmdd  for  Sun 3's, ssuunn44..mmdd for Sun 4's, and ssuunn44cc..mmdd for
     SPARCstation 1's and 2's.

BBOOOOTTIINNGG DDSS33110000''ss
     The basic boot command for a DECstation 3100 is

          bboooott --ff _p_r_o_t_o(())_k_e_r_n_e_l [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]

     where _p_r_o_t_o is either ttffttpp or mmoopp.  Generally  mmoopp  is  pre-
     ferred,  since  it  is  faster  and  more  reliable.  Unfor-
     tunately, it provides no feedback until  the  kernel  starts
     running,  so  you  have  to put up with a 10-30 second pause
     before there's any sign of life.

     The _k_e_r_n_e_l string depends on whether  the  DECstation  knows
     what  server  to  use.   The simplest rule is to always type
     iinniitt to the PROM before booting, and  use  only  the  kernel
     name (e.g., ``sprite'' or ``new'') for _k_e_r_n_e_l.

BOOT                 Administrative Commands                 BOOT



BBOOOOTTIINNGG DDSS55000000''ss
     The boot command for a DECstation 5000 looks like

           bboooott _s_l_o_t//_x_x_x//_k_e_r_n_e_l [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]

     The _s_l_o_t string is the slot  number  for  the  device  being
     booted  from.   You can use the PROM's ccnnffgg command to get a
     list of what devices are installed at  what  slots.   Sprite
     DECstations  typically  have  two  ethernets  installed; you
     should boot from the lower-numbered ethernet.

     The _x_x_x string is the protocol type when  booting  from  the
     net.   Use  mmoopp.   It  is the disk name (e.g., ``rz0'') when
     booting from the disk.

     The _k_e_r_n_e_l string is just the  name  of  the  kernel  (e.g.,
     ``new'').

WWHHEERREE KKEERRNNEELLSS LLIIVVEE
     Machines that boot off of their own disk  typically  have  a
     small boot partition, such as /allspiceA or /lustA.  In this
     case the kernel nneeww would be installed as /allspiceA/new.

     Kernels  that  are  downloaded  from  a  Sprite  server  are
     installed in /sprite/boot (e.g., /sprite/boot/sun3.md/new).

     As a last resort kernels can also be downloaded from Ginger.
     Those    kernels   are   installed   in   /tftpboot   (e.g.,
     /tftpboot/sun3.md/new).  Suns that boot off of  Ginger  must
     have  a  link  in  /tftpboot to their boot program.  See the
     documentation for bboooott(8S) on Ginger.

     WWAARRNNIINNGG:: This section is rather dated and is probably  inac-
     curate in spots.

     This section outlines the sequence of events that occur dur-
     ing  the boot process. The command typed at the prom is used
     to start the downloader, then download the kernel  from  the
     server  and  start  execution. The early part of the boot is
     the same on all machines. Kernel data structures are set  up
     and  kernel processes started.  Late in the boot the machine
     checks for the presence of a disk, and it starts  the  first
     user  process _i_n_i_t_s_p_r_i_t_e.  The actions initsprite takes vary
     depending on the configuration of the  machine.   There  are
     three standard machine configurations.  _C_l_i_e_n_t_s are diskless
     workstations.  They are dependent on the root fileserver  to
     complete  the  boot process.  Machines with disks must check
     them during boot for inconsistencies.   Checking  the  disks
     requires the _f_s_c_h_e_c_k and _f_s_a_t_t_a_c_h programs, and related data
     files.  _S_t_a_n_d_a_l_o_n_e _f_i_l_e_s_e_r_v_e_r_s have these utilities on their
     own  disk,  and  are  therefore  able  to  check their disks

     without the root fileserver.  _D_e_p_e_n_d_e_n_t _f_i_l_e_s_e_r_v_e_r_s  have  a
     disk,  but  it does not contain the needed files.  Dependent
     fileservers must get these files from the root file server.

     Clients
          /boot/initsprite is exec'ed as the first user  process.
          If  "/"  is unavailable the workstation will wait inde-
          finitely, checking  for  "/"  at  1  minute  intervals.
          Initsprite  will  run  /hosts/_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e/bootcmds  if  it
          exists and /boot/bootcmds otherwise.

     Dependent fileservers
          Fileservers will detect the  presence  of  a  disk  and
          attach  it  as "/bootTmp".  This prefix is local to the
          machine  and  is  not  exported.   If   the   directory
          /bootTmp/boot is not found, then the fileserver assumes
          it is  a  dependent  fileserver.   /boot/initsprite  is
          exec'ed as the first user process.  Initsprite will run
          /boot/diskcmds to verify that the disks  are  not  cor-
          rupted.   The table used to mount the disks is found in
          /hosts/$HOST/mount.  Upon completion the  machine  will
          try  to  find a server of "/".  If no server for "/" is
          found the workstation will retry at 1 minute intervals.
          Once  a  server  is  found, /hosts/_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e/bootcmds or
          /boot/bootcmds is  run.   Initsprite  will  delete  the
          "/bootTmp" prefix prior to exiting.

     Standalone fileservers
          A  standalone  fileserver  will  attach  its  disk   as
          /bootTmp  and  then  check  for  /bootTmp/boot.  Having
          found this directory it will create a  new  prefix  "/"
          using  the  /bootTmp  prefix.  These  prefixes  are now
          synonyms and are local to the machine.  The  standalone
          fileserver  can  then proceed with the boot in the same
          manner as a dependent  fileserver.   /boot/diskcmds  is
          run.  Unlike  a dependent fileserver, /boot/diskcmds is
          on the machine's own disk.  The mount table is found in
          /hosts/$HOST/mount, also on the machine's own disk.  At
          some point in the boot the machine has  to  stop  being
          its  own  server  of  "/" and look for the real server.
          This happens after diskcmds has been run.  The  machine
          will delete the "/" prefix and try to open "/".  If the
          open fails the machine  will  try  again  at  1  minute
          intervals.   Once "/" is found the appropriate bootcmds
          is run.  Initsprite will delete the  "/bootTmp"  prefix
          prior to exiting.

     /boot
          /boot is a directory that contains all of the files and
          utilities  needed to boot a Sprite machine.  Standalone
          fileservers each have a /boot directory on their  local

          disk and will use it during the boot process.

     /boot/cmds
          Contains utility programs needed during boot.

     /boot/diskcmds
          Run by fileservers to  check  their  disks.  Note  that
          dependent  fileservers  run  the  diskcmds found on the
          root fileserver.

     /hosts/_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e/mount
          The mount table read  by  fileserver  _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e.   Stan-
          dalone  fileservers  should  have a copy of their mount
          table in /hosts/_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e/mount on both the  local  disk
          and the root fileserver.

     /boot/serverInfo
          Provides machine name and  type  information  to  stan-
          dalone   fileservers.   Standalone  fileservers  cannot
          depend upon the root fileserver being able  to  provide
          /etc/spritehosts  (the  usual place this information is
          found) so they need their own file.   The  file  should
          consist of the appropriate line from /etc/spritehosts.

     /boot/bootcmds
          This file is unique to  the  whole  system.  Standalone
          fileservers  DO  NOT look in their local /boot for this
          file. bootcmds contains commands for  starting  various
          user-level  servers and other system configuration com-
          mands.

     /hosts/_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e/bootcmds
          If  this   file   exists   it   is   run   instead   of
          /boot/bootcmds.

     /boot/rootcmds
          This file contains the commands necessary for a  backup
          root  server  to  actually  export root.  In the normal
          case the file will contain the single line "prefix -x /
          -l /bootTmp".
