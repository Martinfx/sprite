     This script does full (level 0) dumps of all the filesystems
     that  are  normally backed up.  It is normally invoked manu-
     ally over the weekend.

     The script has hard-coded a list of tape devices.  It  dumps
     filesystems  onto the first tape until it gets an error.  It
     then continues with the second tape until  the  next  error,
     etc.   If  it  runs  out of tapes before all the filesystems
     have been dumped, it sends mail to the user dduummppeerr with  the
     name  of the first filesystem in the list that has yet to be
     dumped.

     The  list  of  filesystems   to   dump   is   contained   in
     //sspprriittee//aaddmmiinn//dduummpp//dduummpplliisstt.   If wweeeekkllyydduummpp is invoked with
     the name of a filesystem, it starts  with  that  filesystem,
     skipping  over  the filesystems that appear before it in the
     list.  If wweeeekkllyydduummpp is not given the name of a  filesystem,
     it     looks     for     the    starting    filesystem    in
     //sspprriittee//aaddmmiinn//dduummpp//ddooiinnggwweeeekkllyy.   If  that  file  is  empty,
     wweeeekkllyydduummpp simply starts at the top of the list.

     WWeeeekkllyydduummpp  puts  the  name   of   the   current   user   in
     //sspprriittee//aaddmmiinn//dduummpp//dduummppaalliiaass.   Mail  sent to the ``dumper''
     alias is sent to the user named  in  this  file.  WWeeeekkllyydduummpp
     also  creates the file //sspprriittee//aaddmmiinn//dduummpp//ddooiinnggwweeeekkllyy, which
     disables the daily dumps.  This file  is  removed  when  the
     weekly dumps complete.

     If wweeeekkllyydduummpp detects an error, it sends mail to dduummppeerr  and
     exits.   It  also  creates  a  status  file,  so that if the
     machine running the weekly dumps crashes while the dumps are
     running,  mail  will  be  sent  to  dduummppeerr  when the machine
     reboots, telling about the crash.

     If wweeeekkllyydduummpp is invoked with the --ii flag, it will  initial-
     ize the tapes in both tape drives before starting.
