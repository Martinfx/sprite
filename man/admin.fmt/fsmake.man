     --ddeevv _d_e_v_i_c_e   _D_e_v_i_c_e is the root  name  of  a  device,  i.e.
                   rxy0, rsd1, rsb0

     --ppaarrtt _p_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n
                   _P_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n is a letter indicating a  partition,
                   i.e. a, b, c, d, e, f, g.

     --ddeevvDDiirr _d_e_v_D_i_r
                   _D_e_v_D_i_r is an alternate directory in  which  to
                   find  the  device  file named by concatenating
                   _d_e_v_i_c_e and _p_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n.  The  default  directory
                   name is ``/dev``.

                   _f_i_r_s_t_P_a_r_t_N_a_m_e is the name of the initial  par-
                   tition  on  the disk which contains basic disk
                   geometry information.  The default  is  parti-
                   tion ``a''.

     --wwrriittee        Write the disk.  The default is to  not  write
                   the disk.

     --oovveerrllaapp      Overlap filesystem blocks across  track  boun-
                   daries. The default is to not overlap blocks.

     --rraattiioo        Ratio  of  Kbytes  to  file  descriptors.  The
                   default is 4.

     --tteesstt         Don't write to the disk. This is the default.

     --ssccssii         Compute the disk geometry for a SCSI disk. The
                   geometry  will  be laid out to maximize usable
                   storage.

     --nnoossccssii       Compute the disk geometry for a non-SCSI disk.
                   The  geometry  will  be  laid  out to maximize
                   transfer bandwidth.  The file system currently
                   doesn't  do  anything  intelligent when laying
                   out a file, so this  option  is  probably  not
                   worth anything.

     --hhoosstt _h_o_s_t_I_D  Sets the host id field in the  domain  header.
                   The default is to use the local host id if the

                   device server is the local host, otherwise use
                   the  device server's id.  _H_o_s_t_I_D is either the
                   name or Sprite id of the machine to which  the
                   domain will be attached.

     --bboooott _b_o_o_t_S_e_c_t_o_r_s
                   Number of sectors in  the  root  partition  to
                   reserve for the boot program.

     --rreeppaarrttiittiioonn  This option will change  the  partitioning  of
                   the  disk.  DO  NOT USE IF THE DISK CONTAINS A
                   FILESYSTEM YOU WISH TO KEEP.  Use  the  --ppaarrtt--
                   ddiisskkttaabb  option to use the partitioning infor-
                   mation in the disktab file, otherwise use  the
                   --ssiizzee  option  to  set the size of the current
                   partition.

     --ppaarrttddiisskkttaabb  Use  in  conjunction  with  the   --rreeppaarrttiittiioonn
                   option  to  set the disk partitioning from the
                   disktab file.

     --ssiizzee _p_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e
                   Use  in  conjunction  with  the   --rreeppaarrttiittiioonn
                   option to specify the size of the current par-
                   tition as a percentage of the total disk size.
                   _P_e_r_c_e_n_t_a_g_e is an integer from 0-100.

     --rreeccoonnffiigg     Reconfigures the basic disk geometry.  DO  NOT
                   USE IF THE DISK CONTAINS A FILESYSTEM YOU WISH
                   TO KEEP. If the disk is a non-scsi  disk  then
                   you   must  also  specify  the  --ccoonnffiiggddiisskkttaabb
                   option which causes the disk  geometry  to  be
                   read  from the disktab file.  If the disk is a
                   scsi disk then you may omit the --ccoonnffiiggddiisskkttaabb
                   option.   _F_s_m_a_k_e will then invent a configura-
                   tion that minimizes wasted disk space.

     --ccoonnffiiggddiisskkttaabb
                   Use in conjunction with the  --rreeccoonnffiigg  option
                   to  set the disk configuration (geometry) from
                   the disktab file.

     --ddiisskkttaabbNNaammee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
                   Specify the  disktab  file.   The  default  is
                   /_e_t_c/_d_i_s_k_t_a_b.

     --ddiisskkttyyppee _t_y_p_e
                   Specify the type of disk.  This _t_y_p_e parameter
                   must  be the type of disk found in the disktab
                   file.  This option must be present in order to
                   use the disktab file.

     --llaabbeellttyyppee _t_y_p_e
                   Type of label  to  write  on  the  disk.   The
                   default   is   to   write  whatever  label  is
                   appropriate for the machine on which ffssmmaakkee is
                   run.

     --ddiirr _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                   Copy the specified directory  into  the  newly
                   created filesystem.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     FFssmmaakkee will create a Sprite filesystem on  a  partition.  It
     has  a large number of options and is intended to be invoked
     from a shell script.  FFssmmaakkee's basic function is to create a
     filesystem  out  of  an entire partition by initializing the
     the file descriptor bitmap, data  block  bitmap  and  domain
     header,  and  creating  the root and lost+found directories.
     If you desire you can copy a directory  tree  into  the  new
     filesystem via the --ddiirr option.  The --ddiirr option is intended
     to be used under UNIX.  If you need to copy stuff  into  the
     new  filesystem  under  Sprite  use the uuppddaattee command.  The
     rest of the options are more complex and probably  not  used
     often.   The  disk configuration, such as sectors per track,
     tracks per cylinder, etc, can be  set  using  the  --rreeccoonnffiigg
     option.  Don't use this option if the disk contains anything
     you want to keep, since it may goof up the size and location
     of  the  disk  partition.  If you don't specify the --ccoonnffiigg--
     ddiisskkttaabb option then ffssmmaakkee will make up a configuration that
     minimizes  wasted  disk space.  This only works under Sprite
     and on SCSI disks.  The --rreeppaarrttiittiioonn allows  you  to  change
     the partitioning of the disk.  The --ppaarrttddiisskkttaabb will set the
     partitioning from the disktab file.  Once again,  don't  use
     this option if there is valuable stuff on the disk since you
     may lose it.  If you don't use the --ppaarrttddiisskkttaabb option  then
     you  have  to  use  the  --ssiizzee option to set the size of the
     current partition as a percentage of the  total  disk  size.
     FFssmmaakkee  will adjust the start of all paritions that "follow"
     the current one on the disk.  Note that  ffssmmaakkee  assumes  an
     ordering  on the partitions, ie disk and 'b' is not used. If
     you want to change the size of a bunch  of  partitions  then
     run  ffssmmaakkee  on  the patritions in alphabetical order.  That
     should do the right thing.  The  --rraattiioo  option  allows  you
     change  the ratio of file system blocks to file descriptors.
     Non-SCSI disks can have their  file  system  blocks  overlap
     track  boundaries  by  specifying the --oovveerrllaapp option.  This
     packs more blocks per cylinder.

     The ffssmmaakkee command can be run on a UNIX system to  create  a
     Sprite  filesystem.   There are several differences in func-
     tionality. First, ffssmmaakkee cannot make up a configuration  for

     the  disk.   The  configuration must be set from the disktab
     file.  Second, the --ddiirr option uses a special mechanism  for
     creating Sprite devices.  If ffssmmaakkee comes across a file with
     the suffix "SPRITE_DEV" it is assumed to  be  a  placeholder
     for  a  Sprite device.  The contents of the file specify the
     device server, major number and minor  number.   Lines  that
     are  blank  or  begin with '#' are ignored.  The file should
     contain one line with three integers --  the  device  server
     SpriteID, major number (device type), and minor number (dev-
     ice unit).
