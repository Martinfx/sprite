I modified the vm module for the sun3 so the kernel code and data area can 
grow to 8 megabytes (on machines with at least 8 meg of memory). I've
tested the change and it appears to work.  I'll run it for a while to make
sure everything works before I installed it.

Rather than moving the kernel down in the virtual address space and having
to change everyone's Makefile I stole the additional 4 meg from the file 
system block cache.  With this change the maximum size block cache is
20096 Kbytes which is still more than the amount for physical memory on
any of our sun3's.  Just for reference I made a map of the virtual address
space of the sun3 and sun4.
