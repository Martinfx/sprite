This has fixes to the Rpc_Daemon for all hosts.
This has a large kernel & FS cache for the DS3100
This has FPU hack for DS3100 that kills user-process instead of kernel.
This has process migraiton and other VM fixes for the sun4s.
This has UNIX-compatible Proc_Exec arg lengths
This has Mary's recovery tracing stuff.
This has FPU enable for sun4 and sun4c.
Known Major Bugs Left Outstanding:
	Sun PMEG Stealing still happens
	FS wedge on locked file handle left by Proc_ServerProc
	FS disk corruption (fragmenting bug?)

I think this version was created only during some testing of the
Makefile.  - FD

The horrible bug that's been causing the sparc stations to be unstable is fixed.
Although the PMEG stealing bug fixed in 1.043 was part of it, the rest of it
turned out to be in the new floating point code.  This affects both the sun4
and sun4c.  Also fixed:  user processes killed on the sun4(c)'s due to
bad stack pointers in the underflow and overflow handlers should now be put on
the debug list rather than just being killed.

1.046	Thu Dec 14 14:38:13 PST 1989
This has a fix for sun4c migration at exec time, and for the uninitialized
event field in the PCB.  It also will clean up processes in the PROC_NEW state
if the other host dies at the start of migration.  - FD

This contains the final (I hope) format of the recovery information statistics
so that all kernels from this point onwards should be able to run the
current recovinfo.

This has a new Fscache_FetchBlock that doesn't have the double insert bug.
This may or may not fix the fragment trashing problem (unknown). - BW

This has support for IOC_WRITE_BACK in the file and remote file modules.
The top level routine Fs_WriteBackIDStub doesn't use Fs_IOControl (yet),
so this is forward compatible for when that changes over.  This has new
PageRead and PageWrite FS routines, and a cleaned up interface for
the BlockRead and BlockWrite FS routines. - BW

Bogus version due to error while making kernel.

1.049	Sat Dec 30 15:29:44 PST 1989
New sun4 kernel linked from the fixed fsio module that Brent installed to
fix the problem with data not being written back to disk.

1.051	Sat Jan  6 13:48:22 PST 1990
Added some hooks for gathering further recovery information on the servers.

Dev module includes fix for /dev/null ioctl's that were messing up tx stty's.

1.053	Tue Jan 30 18:03:15 PST 1990
The ds3100 boot routines were modified so that shutdown and rebooting
single user work.  The ds3100 interrupt routines were modified to
prevent bogus FPU in kernel errors.  UpdateFragment was fixed to check
in a cache block under the new disk block number correctly.  Fsrmt_Select
was fixed to mask RPC_TIMEOUT errors.  Net_InetHdrChecksum was backed
out to a previous version to fix ftp/rcp problems.  The MachWindowUnderflow
problem on the sun4 was fixed. 
Sun - LE net driver was optimized to avoid mapping very small packets.
Sun4c - the vm module has new byte-range cache flushing.
Sun - SCSI3 target select bug was fixed and timeout value reduced. 
Bug is raw scsi device access patched.  Scsi INQUIRE command fixed to 
handle UNIT_ATTENTION errors.
The famous "framming" error message has had its spelling corrected.

1.055	Wed Jan 31 16:54:19 PST 1990
Only the sun4 and sun4c are affected by this change:  I fixed a bug
in the new window underflow trap handler that caused some processes to hang.
    New files linked in from the net library.
