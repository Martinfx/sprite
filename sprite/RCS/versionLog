1.043	Tue Nov 28 09:19:03 PST 1989
This has fixes to the Rpc_Daemon for all hosts.
This has a large kernel & FS cache for the DS3100
This has FPU hack for DS3100 that kills user-process instead of kernel.
This has process migraiton and other VM fixes for the sun4s.
This has UNIX-compatible Proc_Exec arg lengths
This has Mary's recovery tracing stuff.
This has FPU enable for sun4 and sun4c.
Known Major Bugs Left Outstanding:
	Sun PMEG Stealing still happens
	FS wedge on locked file handle left by Proc_ServerProc
	FS disk corruption (fragmenting bug?)


1.044	Thu Nov 30 12:08:38 PST 1989
I think this version was created only during some testing of the
Makefile.  - FD

1.045	Thu Nov 30 13:10:22 PST 1989
The horrible bug that's been causing the sparc stations to be unstable is fixed.
Although the PMEG stealing bug fixed in 1.043 was part of it, the rest of it
turned out to be in the new floating point code.  This affects both the sun4
and sun4c.  Also fixed:  user processes killed on the sun4(c)'s due to
bad stack pointers in the underflow and overflow handlers should now be put on
the debug list rather than just being killed.

1.046	Thu Dec 14 14:38:13 PST 1989
This has a fix for sun4c migration at exec time, and for the uninitialized
event field in the PCB.  It also will clean up processes in the PROC_NEW state
if the other host dies at the start of migration.  - FD

This contains the final (I hope) format of the recovery information statistics
so that all kernels from this point onwards should be able to run the
current recovinfo.

This has a new Fscache_FetchBlock that doesn't have the double insert bug.
This may or may not fix the fragment trashing problem (unknown). - BW

This has support for IOC_WRITE_BACK in the file and remote file modules.
The top level routine Fs_WriteBackIDStub doesn't use Fs_IOControl (yet),
so this is forward compatible for when that changes over.  This has new
PageRead and PageWrite FS routines, and a cleaned up interface for
the BlockRead and BlockWrite FS routines. - BW

1.048	Sat Dec 30 15:29:35 PST 1989
Bogus version due to error while making kernel.

1.049	Sat Dec 30 15:29:44 PST 1989
New sun4 kernel linked from the fixed fsio module that Brent installed to
fix the problem with data not being written back to disk.

1.051	Sat Jan  6 13:48:22 PST 1990
Added some hooks for gathering further recovery information on the servers.

Dev module includes fix for /dev/null ioctl's that were messing up tx stty's.

1.053	Tue Jan 30 18:03:15 PST 1990
The ds3100 boot routines were modified so that shutdown and rebooting
single user work.  The ds3100 interrupt routines were modified to
prevent bogus FPU in kernel errors.  UpdateFragment was fixed to check
in a cache block under the new disk block number correctly.  Fsrmt_Select
was fixed to mask RPC_TIMEOUT errors.  Net_InetHdrChecksum was backed
out to a previous version to fix ftp/rcp problems.  The MachWindowUnderflow
problem on the sun4 was fixed. 
Sun - LE net driver was optimized to avoid mapping very small packets.
Sun4c - the vm module has new byte-range cache flushing.
Sun - SCSI3 target select bug was fixed and timeout value reduced. 
Bug is raw scsi device access patched.  Scsi INQUIRE command fixed to 
handle UNIT_ATTENTION errors.
The famous "framming" error message has had its spelling corrected.

1.055	Wed Jan 31 16:54:19 PST 1990
Only the sun4 and sun4c are affected by this change:  I fixed a bug
in the new window underflow trap handler that caused some processes to hang.
Note: the files mach/sun4.md/{machAsmDefs.h,machTraps.s} will have the wrong
RCSID, since I forgot to check them in before doing the install.

1.056	Thu Feb  8 18:22:52 PST 1990
Improved Fsio_StreamReopen
Improved FsrmtFilePageRead (OMAGIC support)
fsync() implemented via IOC_WRITE_BACK and supported by nfsmount
Proc_Exec supports OMAGIC
dev supports 3/50 DMA correctly
fsprefix does't forget hard-wired prefixes
Partial VM hack for 3/60 color frame buffer (something better is coming later)

1.057	Mon Feb 12 11:32:42 PST 1990
Fixes to 1.056 regarding bad assembler (couldn't enter kernel debugger in 056)
Fixes to OMAGIC support (only ds3100 supports OMAGIC)
This has a bug in IOC_WRITE_BACK for local files.  Returns wrong error code.

1.058	Thu Feb 15 12:02:47 PST 1990
New net module that maps in the device.  Needed for newer SparcStations.
Fixed fsdm that handles deletions of swap files right.
Mousetrap in fscache regarding "block no longer dirty" - just a print statement.
Fixed Vm_PageIn so VmCOR errors cause a segment to be nuked.
Also, VmKillSharers only happens once per segment in orderto
prevent overflowing the Proc_CallFunc queue.
procServer.c was fixed so the max number of Proc_ServerProcsis
a function of FSCACHE_MAX_CLEANER_PROCS and VM_MAX_PAGE_OUT_PROCS
fsio was fixed so that fsync() in the local works.
Also, sun3 kernel leaves mapping for frame buffers (0x0fd0000)
intact.

1.059	Tue Feb 20 16:30:30 PST 1990
SIOCRPHYSADDR returns correct status.
Dec disk labels are supported.
Kernel now uses Fmt constants, rather than Swap.
Screen blanking works for ds3100s.
If a disk is not ready when it is attached then a "start unit" scsi command
is sent to the disk.
FSCACHE_MAX_CLEANER_PROCS is used in fsBlockCache.c
Added IOClientKill call after a consistency call-back times-out.
Generate SIGWINCH signal when window size changes.
Patched Host_Dead to clear RECOV_REBOOT_CALLBACKS state bit
which otherwise prevents a subsequent reboot event from being
suppressed (if it occurs before the reboot callbacks complete)


1.060	Fri Mar  2 16:36:20 PST 1990
Fixed "var val val" printf from Vm_Cmd
Td_ControlCooked does byte-swapping - can print from DECstations
Recov_HostAlive fixed so recovery is initiated after a network partition ends.
L1-o reenables the display.
Migration of floating point programs fixed
Vm_PageIn fixed to have proper error handling when the disk fills up.
(This version won't boot on Allspice, a sun4.)

1.061	Wed Mar 14 10:39:49 PST 1990
Added code to Fscache_OkToScavenge that looks for
inconsistencies with respect to the dirty list.
----------------------------
Added Fscache_DeleteFile.  This procedure is to be called after
a file has been deleted from disk.  It ensures that no cache
blocks remain for the file and that the file is not on the dirty list.
----------------------------
Fixed the race present in 1.059 and 1.060 that allows multiple processes
to be doing the reboot callbacks.  The RECOV_FAILED bit was added
to account for failures during the reboot callbacks.  This causes
the reboot callbacks to be retried (if a failure occurs during them).
----------------------------
Changed the panic about a bad server ID in Rpc_Call to a printf
----------------------------
increased limit on ds3100 kernel heap to 16 MB
----------------------------
Patched called to VmMach_GetContext() to handle processes without context
loaded.  sun4c only.  This allows kernel stack traces during debug sessions.


1.062	Thu Mar 29 17:37:37 PST 1990
____________________________________________________________________________
Rpc and Sys:
Added rpc code for servers to generate negative acknowledgements if they
cannot grant an rpc server process to a client request.  The new code contains
2 methods for clients to handle a negative acknowledgement - by backoff or
by ramping down the number of channels they can use with that server.
New hooks have been added to Sys_StatsStub to control, using rpccmd,
the generation of negative acks, the client policy handling
negative acks, and the number and max number of rpc server procs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recov and Sys:
There is also a stub (for recovcmd) to change the pinging policy of client recov
deamons.  This new kernel contains code in the recov module to try to prevent
clients from synchronizing their pings due to server reboots.  They now
ping at absolute intervals from when they rebooted, but using recovcmd you
can change back to the old way if you want to for some weird reason.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mach: (sun4 and sun4c)
If a process is suspended for debug due to a bad stack pointer in the window
underflow trap, you can now kill it, because it checks for KILL signals now.
(ds3100): added Unix compatibility code for semget, semop, semctl, mmap.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sig:
Added a new routine, Sig_CheckForKill() that lets you check for a kill
signal without handling any signals that might take you out to user mode.
This is for the Mach change for the sun4 and sun4c, above.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dev:
You can now skip backwards over files on tape.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vm:
If a swap error occurs on a segment, the segment is made non-sticky so that
the next program to exec it will get a fresh copy.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proc:
Migration fixes for signals as a result of a failed migration; network
partitions causing machines to miss "death notices"; signalling a process 
after the other host thinks you're down and throws away the state associated
with the process on the remote host.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fs: 
Reading a symbolic link now does not include the null byte in the count
of characters read (for unix compatibility).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sync:
Added syncSysV.c, which supports semget, semop, semctl System V semaphore
functions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.063	Wed Apr  4 15:13:55 PDT 1990
Changes on the server side of the new rpc negative acknowledgement stuff so that
neg acks will be backwards-compatible on client machines running old kernels.
I now OR in an RPC_ACK with the RPC_NACK.  I've also fixed some synchronization
problems in the neg ack stuff.

1.064	Wed Apr 18 19:57:19 PDT 1990
I've added print statements to the rpc and recovery modules to trace the
state of the recovery module.  There's a new hook in Sys_Stats to
turn on the printing of these trace statements from the recovcmd.

1.065	Wed May 16 12:31:27 PDT 1990
Device module additions:  changes to allow idle/busy statistics for scsi disks.
Recovery module additions: mouse trap for bad unregister of reboot callback.
Fs* module additions: part of above mouse trap for unregister of reboot funcs.
Sys module additions: removed recursive panic.
Fs_Stat structure augmented for migration and writeback statistics.  Fixed
problem with stream attributes not being invalidated when cached writable
files migrate.  Added rpc to stage new migration callback for obtaining
offset after deencapsulation.
devSCSITape fixed so that a filemark is written on close only if last
access was a write.
Fs_UserClose now returns error codes consistent with the close() man page.


1.066	Thu Jun 21 22:23:13 PDT 1990
includes more of Mary's modifications for nacks.
includes JKO's fs tracing.
includes fix for migration to transfer oversized buffers (large page tables,
right now) and to have servers tell clients that a flushback is due to
migration.


1.067	Thu Jun 28 15:19:38 PDT 1990
fixes migration bugs: pipe buffer being freed if host crash callback closes 
it; argString getting NIL'ed out and then used during migration; various
deadlocks during migration/signals/exiting processes. 

1.068	Sat Jun 30 14:35:58 PDT 1990
Fixes change to ioctl rpc stub that wasn't byte-swapping IOC_REPOSITION for
shadow stream.  Fixes migration not to accidentally leave mig trap signal
blocked.

1.069	Thu Jul 19 17:44:16 PDT 1990
Has statistics for Fred.  Has various fs lock fixes.  Has L1-i function.

1.070	Wed Aug  1 13:12:15 PDT 1990
Has more statistics for Fred.  Has disk mount changes for John.  Has
improved L1-i function.  Has vm/signal changes for fault address.


1.071	Thu Aug 16 01:02:47 PDT 1990
Has frame buffer support for /X11/R4.
Fixes the global register trashing bug on the sun4.


1.075	Tue Sep 11 19:52:13 PDT 1990
Fix for deadlock caused by delete callback.  
First attempt at adding function prototypes.

Ultranet and multiple network interface support.
More function prototypes.
Profiling on the ds3100.
LFS added.
ProcExit closes a process's files in two phases to avoid races between
the vm and fs modules during process exit.

1.079	Tue Dec 11 13:08:36 PST 1990
Sosp traces and counters in place.
vmSun.c:
    Cache flushing during PMEG stealing in the VM module should be faster now.
Merge "extra" Server RPC stats into the regular structure.
fsioStream.c:
    Bug fix to prevent reopens with file types of -1 from indexing through -1
    in the file type switch on the server.  Poison packet fix for clients.
Sparcstation scsi driver added.
FscacheBlocks.c:
    Patched problem with files hanging on dirty list no dirty blocks.

On sun4c's the dma reset is now owned by the dev module and not the net module.
Added support for kgcorein dbgMain.c
Added the mop protocol in devNet.c.

compatibility changes.

fsPageOps.c
Fixed a bug fix.
Fixed stale handle on swap file causing infinite recovery.

devGraphics.c
Changed BOING define to PROM_1_4 since that's the prom revision for
sparcstations that's got the access problem.

New SOSP counters in many of the file system modules to keep track of
cache block lifetimes, etc.

A fix to the new sync'ing code in the sys module.

1.088	Mon Apr  8 18:33:10 PDT 1991

fsio:
Bug fix to the fsio routine that kills client stream handles - the bug
caused a negative reference count panic.

net:
Fixed bug with delayed reset.

sys:
Unix compatibility.

proc:
Unix compatibility.

mach:
Unix compatibility.

1.089	Tue Apr  9 18:52:02 PDT 1991
Fixed a bug in vmSysCall.c, VmMmapInt, that was causing X to die when
accessing a kernel rather than user address for the frame buffer.

1.090	Thu Apr 18 13:27:36 PDT 1991
Changes to SCSI code to support bigger devices.
lockProcID => lockProcPtr.

1.091	Fri Apr 19 13:54:46 PDT 1991

Converted Sys_DiskStats to be sector rather than request count.
Fixed infinite recovery loop due to stale prefixes.
Fixed access to user buffer in Fs_ReadLinkStub().
Fixed a bug in Fs_ReadLinkStub that was a result of a previous bug fix...
Temporary paranoia checks for Proc_StringNCopy.
increased size of kernel heap


1.096	Sat Jun 29 19:30:04 PDT 1991
dbg:
Took out the disk sync code for panics, since it wasn't working and was
causing the machine to pop out of the debugger.

Patch code we unmounts of LFS work.

fslclLookup.c:
Patch incorrect block offset for dir change log.

1) Added code to delete the hash table entry for a directory when the
    name is deleted.  Previous, the code deleted the entry when the
    inode for the directory was delete. This left garbage in the
    hash table for directories that were delete while open.
2) Added code to FindComponent to handle the case when ".." of a directory
    has been deleted.

fsrmtFile.c:
More counters.

lfsBlockIO.c:
Added code to stall allocates until enough clean segments are available.

lfsDesc.c:
Added code to synchronize truncate with write back. This is needed because
both modified the file index and one is trying to remove it from
the cache.

lfsFileLayout.c:
Added code to update the segments timeOfLastWrite we files are added.

lfsMain.c:
Added count of number of dirty block in file cache.

lfsSeg.c, lfsSegUsage.c:
Added new interface between SegUsage and Seg to handle sorting of
segments to clean.  Added code to wait for enough clean segments
before allocate.

procMach.c:
Added check so profiled sun4 code gets counted as sprite, not unix.

procMigrate.c:
When deencapsulating process state, check whether the process is
marked as unmigratable.  Proc_IsMigratedProc renamed to
Proc_IsEvictable.

procRemote.c:
Add debugging check at exit time for foreign processes that are marked
as unmigratable.

procRpc.c:
Temporary paranoia checks for Proc_StringNCopy.
Proc_IsMigratedProcess renamed to Proc_UseRpcBuffer.  Change
Proc_StringNCopy so that it checks Proc_UseRpcBuffer and calls
Vm_StringNCopy if necessary.  Some tweaks to comments.

procTable.c:
Add comment that ProcGetUnusedPCB returns a locked PCB.

profSubr.c:
Proc_StringNCopy now checks Proc_IsMigratedProcess and calls
Vm_StringNCopy if necessary.

sysCalls.c:
New return code for different-sized stats.
Fixed GetDiskStats not to use Vm_CopyOut so we wont get page faults
while under MASTER_LOCKS().

vmSeg.c:
Use Proc_GetCurrentProc() instead of referring directly to
proc_RunningProcesses.

vmSun.c:
Fixing a problem where we try to map pages for too many pmegs.

Changed kernel size for sun4 and sun4c - It's now 40 Meg!

vmSysCall.c:
tried to fix it so that the hole in the ds vm wasn't included in the
count of kernel pages

ds5000.md/mainInit.c:
Fixed initialization of variables.

1.097	Tue Jul 30 20:44:06 PDT 1991

Fix to sun4 compatibility code deadlock.
Fix to disappearing disk space with mapped files.
Select is changed back to old style.

    New files linked in from the net library.
