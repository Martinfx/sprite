This has fixes to the Rpc_Daemon for all hosts.
This has a large kernel & FS cache for the DS3100
This has FPU hack for DS3100 that kills user-process instead of kernel.
This has process migraiton and other VM fixes for the sun4s.
This has UNIX-compatible Proc_Exec arg lengths
This has Mary's recovery tracing stuff.
This has FPU enable for sun4 and sun4c.
Known Major Bugs Left Outstanding:
	Sun PMEG Stealing still happens
	FS wedge on locked file handle left by Proc_ServerProc
	FS disk corruption (fragmenting bug?)


1.044	Thu Nov 30 12:08:38 PST 1989
I think this version was created only during some testing of the
Makefile.  - FD

1.045	Thu Nov 30 13:10:22 PST 1989
The horrible bug that's been causing the sparc stations to be unstable is fixed.
Although the PMEG stealing bug fixed in 1.043 was part of it, the rest of it
turned out to be in the new floating point code.  This affects both the sun4
and sun4c.  Also fixed:  user processes killed on the sun4(c)'s due to
bad stack pointers in the underflow and overflow handlers should now be put on
the debug list rather than just being killed.

1.046	Thu Dec 14 14:38:13 PST 1989
This has a fix for sun4c migration at exec time, and for the uninitialized
event field in the PCB.  It also will clean up processes in the PROC_NEW state
if the other host dies at the start of migration.  - FD

This contains the final (I hope) format of the recovery information statistics
so that all kernels from this point onwards should be able to run the
current recovinfo.

This has a new Fscache_FetchBlock that doesn't have the double insert bug.
This may or may not fix the fragment trashing problem (unknown). - BW

This has support for IOC_WRITE_BACK in the file and remote file modules.
The top level routine Fs_WriteBackIDStub doesn't use Fs_IOControl (yet),
so this is forward compatible for when that changes over.  This has new
PageRead and PageWrite FS routines, and a cleaned up interface for
the BlockRead and BlockWrite FS routines. - BW

1.048	Sat Dec 30 15:29:35 PST 1989
Bogus version due to error while making kernel.

1.049	Sat Dec 30 15:29:44 PST 1989
New sun4 kernel linked from the fixed fsio module that Brent installed to
fix the problem with data not being written back to disk.

1.051	Sat Jan  6 13:48:22 PST 1990
Added some hooks for gathering further recovery information on the servers.

Dev module includes fix for /dev/null ioctl's that were messing up tx stty's.

1.053	Tue Jan 30 18:03:15 PST 1990
The ds3100 boot routines were modified so that shutdown and rebooting
single user work.  The ds3100 interrupt routines were modified to
prevent bogus FPU in kernel errors.  UpdateFragment was fixed to check
in a cache block under the new disk block number correctly.  Fsrmt_Select
was fixed to mask RPC_TIMEOUT errors.  Net_InetHdrChecksum was backed
out to a previous version to fix ftp/rcp problems.  The MachWindowUnderflow
problem on the sun4 was fixed. 
Sun - LE net driver was optimized to avoid mapping very small packets.
Sun4c - the vm module has new byte-range cache flushing.
Sun - SCSI3 target select bug was fixed and timeout value reduced. 
Bug is raw scsi device access patched.  Scsi INQUIRE command fixed to 
handle UNIT_ATTENTION errors.
The famous "framming" error message has had its spelling corrected.

1.055	Wed Jan 31 16:54:19 PST 1990
Only the sun4 and sun4c are affected by this change:  I fixed a bug
in the new window underflow trap handler that caused some processes to hang.
Note: the files mach/sun4.md/{machAsmDefs.h,machTraps.s} will have the wrong
RCSID, since I forgot to check them in before doing the install.

1.056	Thu Feb  8 18:22:52 PST 1990
Improved Fsio_StreamReopen
Improved FsrmtFilePageRead (OMAGIC support)
fsync() implemented via IOC_WRITE_BACK and supported by nfsmount
Proc_Exec supports OMAGIC
dev supports 3/50 DMA correctly
fsprefix does't forget hard-wired prefixes
Partial VM hack for 3/60 color frame buffer (something better is coming later)

1.057	Mon Feb 12 11:32:42 PST 1990
Fixes to 1.056 regarding bad assembler (couldn't enter kernel debugger in 056)
Fixes to OMAGIC support (only ds3100 supports OMAGIC)
This has a bug in IOC_WRITE_BACK for local files.  Returns wrong error code.

1.058	Thu Feb 15 12:02:47 PST 1990
New net module that maps in the device.  Needed for newer SparcStations.
Fixed fsdm that handles deletions of swap files right.
Mousetrap in fscache regarding "block no longer dirty" - just a print statement.
Fixed Vm_PageIn so VmCOR errors cause a segment to be nuked.
Also, VmKillSharers only happens once per segment in orderto
prevent overflowing the Proc_CallFunc queue.
procServer.c was fixed so the max number of Proc_ServerProcsis
a function of FSCACHE_MAX_CLEANER_PROCS and VM_MAX_PAGE_OUT_PROCS
fsio was fixed so that fsync() in the local works.
Also, sun3 kernel leaves mapping for frame buffers (0x0fd0000)
intact.

1.059	Tue Feb 20 16:30:30 PST 1990
SIOCRPHYSADDR returns correct status.
Dec disk labels are supported.
Kernel now uses Fmt constants, rather than Swap.
Screen blanking works for ds3100s.
If a disk is not ready when it is attached then a "start unit" scsi command
is sent to the disk.
FSCACHE_MAX_CLEANER_PROCS is used in fsBlockCache.c
Added IOClientKill call after a consistency call-back times-out.
Generate SIGWINCH signal when window size changes.
Patched Host_Dead to clear RECOV_REBOOT_CALLBACKS state bit
which otherwise prevents a subsequent reboot event from being
suppressed (if it occurs before the reboot callbacks complete)


1.060	Fri Mar  2 16:36:20 PST 1990
Fixed "var val val" printf from Vm_Cmd
Td_ControlCooked does byte-swapping - can print from DECstations
Recov_HostAlive fixed so recovery is initiated after a network partition ends.
L1-o reenables the display.
Migration of floating point programs fixed
Vm_PageIn fixed to have proper error handling when the disk fills up.
(This version won't boot on Allspice, a sun4.)

1.061	Wed Mar 14 10:39:49 PST 1990
Added code to Fscache_OkToScavenge that looks for
inconsistencies with respect to the dirty list.
----------------------------
Added Fscache_DeleteFile.  This procedure is to be called after
a file has been deleted from disk.  It ensures that no cache
blocks remain for the file and that the file is not on the dirty list.
----------------------------
Fixed the race present in 1.059 and 1.060 that allows multiple processes
to be doing the reboot callbacks.  The RECOV_FAILED bit was added
to account for failures during the reboot callbacks.  This causes
the reboot callbacks to be retried (if a failure occurs during them).
----------------------------
Changed the panic about a bad server ID in Rpc_Call to a printf
----------------------------
increased limit on ds3100 kernel heap to 16 MB
----------------------------
Patched called to VmMach_GetContext() to handle processes without context
loaded.  sun4c only.  This allows kernel stack traces during debug sessions.


1.062	Thu Mar 29 17:37:37 PST 1990
____________________________________________________________________________
Rpc and Sys:
Added rpc code for servers to generate negative acknowledgements if they
cannot grant an rpc server process to a client request.  The new code contains
2 methods for clients to handle a negative acknowledgement - by backoff or
by ramping down the number of channels they can use with that server.
New hooks have been added to Sys_StatsStub to control, using rpccmd,
the generation of negative acks, the client policy handling
negative acks, and the number and max number of rpc server procs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recov and Sys:
There is also a stub (for recovcmd) to change the pinging policy of client recov
deamons.  This new kernel contains code in the recov module to try to prevent
clients from synchronizing their pings due to server reboots.  They now
ping at absolute intervals from when they rebooted, but using recovcmd you
can change back to the old way if you want to for some weird reason.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mach: (sun4 and sun4c)
If a process is suspended for debug due to a bad stack pointer in the window
underflow trap, you can now kill it, because it checks for KILL signals now.
(ds3100): added Unix compatibility code for semget, semop, semctl, mmap.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sig:
Added a new routine, Sig_CheckForKill() that lets you check for a kill
signal without handling any signals that might take you out to user mode.
This is for the Mach change for the sun4 and sun4c, above.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dev:
You can now skip backwards over files on tape.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vm:
If a swap error occurs on a segment, the segment is made non-sticky so that
the next program to exec it will get a fresh copy.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proc:
Migration fixes for signals as a result of a failed migration; network
partitions causing machines to miss "death notices"; signalling a process 
after the other host thinks you're down and throws away the state associated
with the process on the remote host.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fs: 
Reading a symbolic link now does not include the null byte in the count
of characters read (for unix compatibility).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sync:
Added syncSysV.c, which supports semget, semop, semctl System V semaphore
functions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.063	Wed Apr  4 15:13:55 PDT 1990
Changes on the server side of the new rpc negative acknowledgement stuff so that
neg acks will be backwards-compatible on client machines running old kernels.
I now OR in an RPC_ACK with the RPC_NACK.  I've also fixed some synchronization
problems in the neg ack stuff.

1.064	Wed Apr 18 19:57:19 PDT 1990
I've added print statements to the rpc and recovery modules to trace the
state of the recovery module.  There's a new hook in Sys_Stats to
turn on the printing of these trace statements from the recovcmd.

1.065	Wed May 16 12:31:27 PDT 1990
Device module additions:  changes to allow idle/busy statistics for scsi disks.
Recovery module additions: mouse trap for bad unregister of reboot callback.
Fs* module additions: part of above mouse trap for unregister of reboot funcs.
Sys module additions: removed recursive panic.
Fs_Stat structure augmented for migration and writeback statistics.  Fixed
problem with stream attributes not being invalidated when cached writable
files migrate.  Added rpc to stage new migration callback for obtaining
offset after deencapsulation.
devSCSITape fixed so that a filemark is written on close only if last
access was a write.
Fs_UserClose now returns error codes consistent with the close() man page.


1.066	Thu Jun 21 22:23:13 PDT 1990
includes more of Mary's modifications for nacks.
includes JKO's fs tracing.
includes fix for migration to transfer oversized buffers (large page tables,
right now) and to have servers tell clients that a flushback is due to
migration.

    New files linked in from the net library.
