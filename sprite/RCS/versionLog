The horrible bug that's been causing the sparc stations to be unstable is fixed.
Although the PMEG stealing bug fixed in 1.043 was part of it, the rest of it
turned out to be in the new floating point code.  This affects both the sun4
and sun4c.  Also fixed:  user processes killed on the sun4(c)'s due to
bad stack pointers in the underflow and overflow handlers should now be put on
the debug list rather than just being killed.
